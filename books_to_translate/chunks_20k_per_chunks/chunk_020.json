  "source_text": "If demand shifts in your markets or a competitor launches a major encroachment, you have to examine what that means for you. Naturally, you will not do that every week, unless the occurrence is so incisive that it requires a speedy risk assessment. Furthermore, you will not change your target vision with its associated impact statement, customer benefit and playing field within a year either. A considerably longer half-life should be applied to the impact statement and customer benefit. However, this could be different for your objectives and key results. Here you can fine-tune and reprioritize easily, for example, to keep your organization agile. You will have different time frames in the action areas for\n\n---\n\n\ninitiatives, projects and measures, as well as for their expansion and amendment. On the one hand, you should adjust the associated roadmap at least monthly to stay on track. On the other hand, you should only put the entire StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ under the microscope once a year.\n\n# STEP BY STEP \n\nA new strategy is an incisive experience for every company. Its implementation entails a lot of changes. Some of them might be small steps, others more evolutionary and others again absolutely system-altering and therefore revolutionary. We hope we have given you many stimuli and recommendations for your strategy process in this book. These suggestions won't always meet with approval in your organization - despite the involvement and participation of those affected - because they call experienced realities, traditions or simply habits into question. You are very ambitious to be taking on a new strategy. To make sure you don't overextend yourself, you should also examine yourself and regularly question your own thoughts and actions. Big changes always start with little ones. Take it step by step - to be a little better every day.\n\n## ESTABLISH NEW STRATEGY ROUTINES\n\n\"Can one tiny change transform your life? (...) The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent improvement, but a thousand of them. It's a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each one a fundamental unit of the overall system. (...) Each improvement is like adding a grain of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tilting things in your favor.\"\n\nFrom the perspective of people successfully changing behavior, Clear (2020) describes how tiny changes can have a big impact. And after all, despite all the rationality and earnestness, there is also a lot of humanity inherent in your strategy process. Nothing in this process is really possible without the ideas, the commitment and the persistence that you, your management team and everyone in your organization put in.\n\nTransform your new habits into routines with the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$.\n\n---\n\n\n# STRATEGY ROUTINES \n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\n## ROUTINE OVERVIEW\n\n| SYMBOL | CYCLE | MEETING FORMAT | DURATION | STRATEGY FRAME ${ }^{\\text {M MODULE }}$ |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n|  | 3 to 5 years | Strategy Workshops I-III | see Process <br> steps 1-4 | Entire module |\n|  | 1x per year | Strategy Retreat | 2 days | Situation analysis (markets, customer segments, offering, <br> objectives \\& key results)/target vision (objectives \\& key <br> results)/action areas (roadmap) |\n|  | 3x per year | Strategy Update | 1 day | Situation analysis (market, competition, trends, broader <br> environment)/target vision (objectives \\& key results)/action <br> areas (innovation, roadmap) |\n|  | 8x per year | Strategy Review | 0.5 day | Target vision (objectives \\& key results)/action areas <br> (innovation, roadmap) |\n|  | If urgently needed | Strategy Check | tbd. | Situation analysis (unusual events arising from competitor <br> environment, broader environment)/action areas (structures <br> \\& processes, people, culture, data \\& IT) |\n\n---\n\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nROUTINES AFTER WORKFLOW \\& COMMITTEES\n\n|  | STRATEGY SPONSOR + <br> MANAGEMENT + <br> PROCESS MANAGER | OBJECTIVES SPONSORS (MAX. 5 PEOPLE) | COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES (MAX. 5 PEOPLE) | INNOVATION MANAGERS (MAX. 10 PEOPLE) |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| OBJECTIVES COMMITTEE | $\\checkmark$ | $\\checkmark$ |  |  |\n| TRANSEORMA- <br> TION STEERING COMMITTEE | $\\checkmark$ | $\\checkmark$ | $\\checkmark$ |  |\n| INNOVATION <br> STEERING COMMITTEE | $\\checkmark$ |  |  | $\\checkmark$ |\n\n---\n\n\n# MEETING ROUTINES \n\n## STRATEGY CHECK\n\nAn ad-hoc format at the level of the steering committees that only comes into play if far-reaching and incisive events or changes occur in the markets or the broader environment. When there are general obstacles in strategy implementation at the operational level, the format provides an opportunity to develop solutions quickly on site without going through big committees.\n\n## STRATEGY REVIEW\n\nA monthly format to examine the teams' progress as well as to check the achievement of the objectives and key results in the \"Objectives\" steering committee. The task of the \"Transformation\" steering committee (comprising five representatives from the \"Objectives\" as well as representatives from the strategy network) comprises the progress check, any resource issues and risks regarding the implementation of initiatives, projects and measures in the action areas as well as adjustments to the roadmap, if these are necessary.\n\n## STRATEGY UPDATE\n\nA quarterly format to bring all group levels and steering committees up to speed on the areas of market, competitors and broader environment and discuss adjustment options.\n\nThe \"Objectives\" steering committee compares the objectives and key results, specifies new ones for the next quarter and cascades these down in the existing hierarchy.\n\nThe \"Transformation\" steering committee discusses the distribution of resources, the risk assessment as well as the approval of further far-reaching measures and updates the roadmap.\n\nThe \"Innovation\" steering committee evaluates the relevant microtrends based on the current trend radar and decides on the action required. It also examines the current status of ongoing innovation measures and approves new funding for tests. Preparation for innovation projects in another status or the implementation of venture capital projects are also discussed here.\n\n---\n\n\n# STRATEGY RETREAT \n\nOnce a year, you should set aside 2 days with your management team to question all the major elements of your StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$. Based on a comprehensively updated situation analysis, you will examine which challenges exist, how far you have come in creating your playing field, if your measures are working and paying into the achievement of the target vision and where your innovation projects stand. You can conduct the \"target-actual\" comparison on all important levels and fine-tune if necessary.\n\n---\n\n\n# ADJUST \n\nYour environment is not standing still. At the same time, your company is moving in the direction defined by the new strategy. This means constant adjustment - not of the whole thing, but of many small parameters so that you can consistently stay on the strategy implementation track.\n\n## KEY QUESTIONS:\n\n1. Are your markets changing, is there any news about the competition, or are there far-reaching events pending in the broader environment that were not foreseeable? Who is responsible for the updates, or can these be automated?\n2. Are there new trends for which urgent action is required?\n3. How often should you adjust your strategy and the individual modules in the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ ?\n4. How is your objective achievement progressing? What is hindering this, or can you up the ante?\n5. Who is serving on which steering committees?\n6. Who ensures the synchronization of the overall process and the individual committees?\n7. When should you launch a completely new strategy process?\n\n## INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Define the various steering committees for 6 to 12 months in advance.\n2. Ensure that the coordinating committees at team or community level are also stipulated for 6 to 12 months.\n3. Appoint the participants of the individual committees as well as a chairperson for each one.\n4. Ensure the availability of a clear and centrally accessible tracking system.\n5. Define managers, service providers and/or tools for the updates in the module \"Market\", for \"Competition\", for \"Broader Environment\" and \"Trends\".\n6. Determine when you want to launch the next full-fledged strategy process.\n\n## TIP\n\nUse the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ and the associated cards for the individual modules to conduct the adjustment. This ensures that the old data is retained, and and you still have an overview of the overall context of the individual components that are changing.\n\n## CAUTION\n\nEnsure that information about adjusted objectives and measures is communicated across the horizontal and vertical axes. With the passage of time, individual colleagues frequently succumb to the temptation to disappear into their silos again or no longer adhere to the collective agreements. Then there is a risk not only that the implementation will come to a standstill, but also of a potential asynchronicity in your strategy implementation as well as in your business model.\n\n---\n\n\n# SET STRATEGY ROUTINES\n\n|   | STRATEGY REVIEW | STRATEGY UPDATE | MANAGER | PARTICIPANTS  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  OBJECTIVES\nSTEERING\nCOMMITTEE |  |  |  | 7  |\n|  TRANSFORMATION\nSTEERING\nCOMMITTEE |  |  |  | 12  |\n|  INNOVA-\nTION STEERING\nCOMMITTEE |  |  |  | Tbd.  |\n|  TEAM COORDINATION |  |  |  |   |\n|  COMMUNITY UPDATE |  |  |  |   |\n|  INNOVATION TEAMS |  |  |  |   |\n\nUPDATE Manager/Service provider/Tools:\n\nMarket: $\\qquad$\n\nCompetition: $\\qquad$\n\nBroader environment: $\\qquad$\n\nTrends: $\\qquad$\n\nStart new strategy process $\\qquad$\n\n---\n\n\n# THE DIGITAL STRATEGYFRAME ${ }^{\\circledR}$ \n\n## SOFTWARE, PLATFORM \\& COMMUNITY\n\n## STRATEGY-FRAME.COM\n\nAbove and beyond our book, we want to support you as best we can in developing and implementing your strategy with your team autonomously.
