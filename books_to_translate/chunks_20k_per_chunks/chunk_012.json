Of Environmental Sciences, University of Basel\n\nAfter you have determined \"where you stand\" and the pitfalls of challenge have been clearly named, the next step is the new target vision for your company: \"Where do we want to go?\" However, the target vision is multi-layered and does not comprise just one major objective or other like: \"we want to become number 1 or number 2 in the market.\"\n\nWhat you have to do here is determine the focus for your future actions. In this phase of the workshop, things will usually start to \"hot up\". After all, the word \"focus\" is derived from the Latin word for \"hearth\" or \"hotspot\". You will have to lead controversial discussions and make difficult decisions because focusing also means, based on the \"You can't have it all\" principle, having to give up certain activities, markets, or customer segments. For this reason, there will be executives in your ranks who will also regard \"No, we won't be doing that anymore in future,\" as a decision against them personally, their performance or their aspirations. Leaving all rational decision-making aside, what you need here is tact, empathy, and creativity if you want your fellow executives to feel included in the future vision for your company.\n\n## DETERMINE THE FOCUS TOGETHER\n\nFor the remainder of Strategy Workshop I, you will work through the following four modules with your team:\n\n## 1. IMPACT STATEMENT (BHAG)\n\nWhat lasting effect do you want to achieve with your company?\n\nThe impact statement will form the roof of your target building. It expresses which value-adding contribution your company wishes to make to the economy, society and the environment and be profitable in doing so. As a matter of fact, you can also alternatively use an existing mission statement comprising your vision, mission and values.\n\n---\n\n\n# 2. CUSTOMER BENEFIT \\& SUPERIOR PROFITS (WINNING PROPOSITION) \n\nHow will you achieve a greater or a different benefit than your competition for your customers? How will that enable you to generate higher profits than your competitors?\n\nCustomers will purchase and consume a product from your company if the net benefit of your product, meaning the benefit that the customer subjectively perceives minus the price she has to pay for it, is higher than that of rival products. If you create a higher net benefit than the rivals, you have what Willie Pietersen (2001) calls a \"winning proposition\". But remember: It is the customer, not you, who decides whether there is a differentiation! The differentiating benefit will attract customers but is not sufficient to win them over. In fact, the differentiation from the competition has to also lead to superior profits. Put differently: The difference between revenue and costs must be higher than that of your competitors. Thus the \"winning proposition\" has to be a \"paying proposition\" as well. You want to attract and retain those customers who are profitable for your company. Thus, the competition for superior value added has two fronts: customers and costs.\n\n## 3. TARGET MARKETS, CUSTOMER SEGMENTS, OFFERINGS\n\nThe competitive focus determines the playing field and forms the core of the target vision: Which markets do we want to serve?\n\nDecide which sectors, business fields, and geographic areas you want to be active in.\n\nWho should your customers be?\n\nDecide which customer segments you want to serve in the selected markets, sectors, and geographic areas.\n\n---\n\n\nWhich offerings do you want to have in the market?\nWhich offerings will you not have?\n\nDefine your offering portfolio. Decide which products and services you would like to offer to which customers. A key factor for your selection is your expectations and assessments of your customers' future requirements.\n\n# 4. OBJECTIVES \\& KEY RESULTS \n\nWhich qualitative objectives do you want to realize, which quantitative key results do you want to achieve?\n\nYour target building comprises the most important priorities for implementing your impact statement, differentiating customer benefit and achieving superior profits for your selected competitive focus. These priorities should portray the \"critical success factors\" that make the biggest difference to company profits. Keep the number of objectives low: three to a maximum of five objectives are enough. The longer the list of objectives, the lower the probability of achieving every one of them.\n\nThe \"winning proposition\" addresses the market and customers. By contrast, objectives and key results have an inward impact. They show the organization on what to concentrate its energy and resources and how it should be mobilized to realize the \"winning proposition\" and generate the desired impact.\n\n---\n\n\n# \"A GOAL WITHOUT A PLAN IS JUST A WISH.\" \n\nAntoine de Saint-Exupéry, French author and pilot\n\n---\n\n\n# MAKE A REAL IMPACT \n\nWho doesn't know them: the boring or interchangeable mission statements on long corporate corridors? The visions there vary in their slogans between market leader and number one. Seemingly strange interpretations of missions and visions for which one thing is already clear at first glance - nothing is clear here. The entire thing is then garnished with a potpourri of values that frequently either make you lose your appetite or simply don't whet it at all. And yes, mission statements are important, and yes, developing good mission statements is an art. That is why they are so rare.\n\nSo why is it that many companies nonetheless try to conduct a mission statement process at the same time as the strategy process? After all, we have read and learned: no strategy without a mission statement. The mission statement is both anchor and guiding star, but often enough it deteriorates into a stopgap, and in the end, it is not a silver bullet either. Of course, your strategy should be based on something significant, but one statement has proven to be true in the past 15 years of our practical experience: Better no mission statement than a mind-bogglingly bad one.\n\nUncouple the mission statement process from the strategy process\n\nSo: all or nothing. Either you uncouple the mission statement process from the strategy process and put the first one before the second one with sufficient time in-between, or you need a new alternative.\n\nYour vision statement will show which mountain you want to climb, meaning what you want to achieve and how achieving the goal feels. Then your mission statement will be your Polaris and describe how you want to scale the mountain.\n\nAlong with your corporate values and principles, the vision and its mission reflect your company's action philosophy. They should therefore be oriented towards persistence and sustainability. Time frames are hard to designate in our fastmoving and disruptive times. A vision aims at a time frame of 5 to 15 years. The mission acts as an instruction manual for how the company should fulfil the vision, and determines the short-, medium- and long-term objectives. Clarity on your action philosophy will help you and your organization to make strategic decisions in the face of the challenges in constantly changing environments. For external stakeholders too, like for example, customers, banks, investors, or potential employees, clarity about values, principles, vision, and mission can make the decisive difference.\n\n---\n\n\n# VISION \n\nWhere do we want\nto be in 5-15 years?\n\n## MISSION\n\nWhy do we exist?\nWhat is driving us?\n\n## CORPORATE PRINCIPLES\n\nWhat do we stand for? What are our values?\n\nAdapted from Esch (2021)\n\n## STRETCH THE GOAL\n\nTime is short and therefore precious. If you want to generate real momentum with the power to inspire, we recommend a real alternative that will ensure clarity. We know that many roads lead to Rome. This is one way to give your strategy traction.\n\nIn practice, the BHAG method - pronounced \"be-hag\" - devised by Collis and Porras in the mid-1990s has proven itself. BHAG stands for \"big hairy audacious goals\" - so large, challenging or daring objectives. This is about the incentive, the search for the impact. And when we talk about truly big objectives, you really have to take that literally.\n\n---\n\n\nYour BHAG should be inspiring and long-term and thus raise your company up to the next level. BHAGs are enormous tasks that can take 10 to 15 years to implement. They shift the boundaries of what your company achieves and challenge your team to make immense progress. The boundaries between visions and BHAGs are fluid. When they are defined for the first time, BHAGs often appear to be objectives that are almost impossible to achieve. Think of US President John F. Kennedy's announcement in 1961 that the USA would send a person to the moon before the end of the decade. In 1961, an aspiration like this appeared to be more like a dream than a potential future reality. But by formulating this objective, President Kennedy inspired Americans to make the seemingly impossible possible.\n\n# ACHIEVE THE IMPOSSIBLE \n\nHowever, to give the BHAGs a bit more depth, increase their inspirational potential and thus receive a combination of mission and vision with a hefty shot of adrenalin, we gave the target direction for the BHAG the term \"impact\". This addition is geared to the impact that the company would like to achieve and has high inspirational potential with the right formulation.\n\nWhy impact? Impact statements show how you generate a verifiable sustainable difference in people's lives, in the environment (environmental) and in society (societal) with responsible corporate management (governance). This involves your company's ESG contribution. That means the impact statement closes the gap between BHAG and ESG - and thus sustainability in a holistic sense. Documentation of the results of your efforts is also being increasingly expected by financiers and interest groups. Determining what impact you want to achieve with your actions will help you do this.\n\n---\n\n\n# STORIES FROM THE FIELD \n\nOne of the finest examples of BHAG with a big impact comes from automotive manufacturer Volvo:\n\"By 2020, no one will die in a new Volvo anymore.\"\nVolvo drew the consequence from this that all new cars would be restricted to a speed limit of $180 \\mathrm{kph}(112 \\mathrm{mph})$. Very resolute and strong.\n\nThere are basically four types of BHAG:\n\n1. TARGET-ORIENTED:\n\nSet yourself a clearly defined quantitative or qualitative objective.\nFor example:\n\"Enable human exploration and settlement of Mars.\" SpaceX\n2. COMPETITION-DRIENTED:\n\nCompete with a common enemy.\nFor example:\n\"Crush Adidas.\" Nike\n3. ROLE MODEL:\n\nImitate the characteristics of another successful company that is not one of your direct competitors.\n\nFor example:\n\"Harvard of the West\" Stanford\n4. INTERNAL TRANSFORMATION:\n\nConcentrate internally on your own changes.\nFor example:\n\"Becoming the best global entertainment distribution service.\" NETFLIX\n\nThe target-oriented version is the most suitable for an impact-oriented BHAG.\n\n---\n\n\n# IMPACT STATEMENT \n\nFormulating a real BHAG with a lasting impact with your team can release unimaginable powers and even enthusiasm. During Strategy Workshop I, formulating the BHAG heralds the development of the shared target vision. For this reason, it makes sense to separate this part more distinctly from the situation analysis as regards the timing or location. Because while structure and analytical skills tend to be required more for the situation analysis, this requires more creative energy and skills.\n\n## KEY QUESTIONS:\n\n1. What is our great passion?\n2. What can our company be the best in the world at?\n3. What drives our economic engine?\n\n- Is it profit per customer?\n- Profit per subscription?\n- What is our \" $x$ \" in \"profit per $x$ \"?\n\n\n## INSTRUCTIONS\n\nHow do you create this type of BHAG with impact? Imagine, you have three circles with the above-listed three key questions: At the interface of these three circles you will find your target-oriented BHAG with impact. You can now separate the three circles from each other. To do this, use what is known as the \"magic triangle\". Create it in the room with three writable or sticky surfaces. In rotation, your workshop participants can now collect the key points for the individual key questions under extreme time pressure. At five-minute intervals, one participant always switches group. This way, you compel the participants to focus on what is most important and curtail endless discussions. You can do the finetuning on the final formulation after the event too.\n\n## TIP\n\nYou can also combine the formulation of your BHAG methodically with the formulation of your differentiating customer benefit and superior profits. For example, in one or two sentences. To do this, replace the three circles in the \"magic triangle\" with the three modules of the target vision - impact, customer benefit, and profits - along with their respective key questions.\n\n## CHECKLIST:\n\nIs your BHAG ...\n\n1. ... audacious enough to inspire?\n2. ... clear and unequivocal so that it is evident when the objective has been achieved?\n3. ... in accordance with the company's goals and principles?\n4. ... realizable over a time frame of 10 to 15 years?\n\n## CAUTION\n\nBefore you set a goal, you should ensure that it is inspiring. It is ok if its achievement appears to be almost impossible - that is precisely what makes this goal a BHAG. When you are formulating the BHAG, please avoid merely setting revenue, margin, or market share objectives. Purely financial objectives fail to have an impact, do not generate the desired motivational incentive and are only exciting to a few team members. Revenue and profits are outcomes and not an end in themselves. Describe the issue or the problem (relevance) that you want to solve in simple and suitable language for your main target audience. If your goal is mainly qualitative, you should ensure that there is a clear way to measure success.\n\n---\n\n\n# SOURCES \n\n## FORMULATE\n\n## WHAT IS OUR GREAT PASSION?\n\nWHAT CAN OUR COMPANY BE THE BEST IN THE WORLD AT?\n\nWHAT DRIVES OUR ECONOMIC ENGINE?\n\n---\n\n\n# IMPACT STATEMENT\n\n---\n\n\n# FORMULATE YOUR IMPACT STATEMENT \n\n## EXAMPLES OF BHAGS OR VISIONS WITH IMPACT:\n\nAirbnb: Create a world where everyone can belong everywhere.\nEvernote: Remember everything.\nFeeding America: Ensuring fair access to nutritional food for everyone.\nFacebook: Connect the world.\nGoogle: Organize the world's information.\nMichael J. Fox Foundation: Find a cure for Parkinson's disease.\nMicrosoft: A computer on every desk and in every home.\nSpotify: Unlock the potential of human creativity.\nTesla: To accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.\n\n---\n\n\n# CUSTOMER BENEFIT \\& SUPERIOR PROFITS \n\n## BETTER, DIFFERENT AND MORE PROFITABLE\n\n\"Don't be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.\"\nJohn D. Rockefeller, US entrepreneur\nOnce you have a clear picture of what impact you want to generate, you can define your company's \"winning proposition\" (Pietersen, 2001). It is the answer to the question of what you will do differently or better than your competitors to generate a greater benefit for your target customers and higher profits for your company.\n\nThus a \"winning proposition\" has two complementary elements: differentiating customer benefit and superior profits.\n\n## DIFFERENTIATING CUSTOMER BENEFIT\n\nIn competitive markets, customers always have a choice. Why should customers buy from you and not from the competition? Describe the benefit that customers will receive from you in comparison to the competing alternatives. Formulate this benefit in simple words, but make it concrete.\n\n## SUPERIOR PROFITS\n\nProfits are an economic necessity: without profits or profit prospects, there are no investments. And without investments in new products, technologies, and business fields, a company will not be able to survive in the long term. If your company is not capable of generating above-average profits, competitors with higher operational performance and greater financial resources will force you out of the market sooner or later. The difference that you want to achieve with a differentiating customer benefit must pay off and give you a profit advantage. The revenue-increasing differentiating customer benefit is one side of the profit coin, cost efficiency is the other. However, absolute profit is not very informative without putting it into context against use of resources. That is why we look at your company's profitability measured, for example, by the return on sales or the return on capital employed. Whatever else, you must exceed your capital costs (cost of equity and debt capital). You have profit-oriented superiority compared to the competition when your company's profitability exceeds that of your competitors.\n\n---\n\n\nTo do this, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n\n- Which investments do we have to make to realize a \"differentiating customer benefit\"?\n- How high are the profits we can expect?\n- What risks do these profits entail?\n- Which business model do we need to produce the beneficial offerings and launch them on the markets?\n- How will this business model improve our ability to reduce costs and/or increase revenues?\n\n\n# DIFFERENTIATE WITH LOW COSTS \n\n\"Value innovation\" is the magic word from the blue ocean universe (Kim \\& Mauborgne, 2015). Similar to the \"winning proposition\", value innovation has two features that are relevant to competition: on the one hand, the benefit that is tailored to the target customers, or \"personas\", on the other hand, low costs. However, your focus should be on alternatives in the value offering for non-customers to enable you to tap new or even better, competition-free markets - blue oceans.\n\nIf you now think about Porter's generic strategies, a feeling of unease should be setting in by now. Isn't innovation or quality leadership incompatible with cost leadership? Not necessarily. The art is in banking on offering features that provide new or additional benefits for the customer but incur few additional costs to your company. Conversely, offering features that target customers regard as \"nice to have\", but superfluous, are reduced or removed completely. Value innovation is not about expensive research projects and development budgets. When you eliminate and reduce offering features, you generally lower costs. However, at the same time, you also reduce the customer benefit emanating from the feature. Although creating and enhancing offering features increases costs, it leads in return to more satisfied or new customer groups. With the aid of Kim \\& Mauborgne's (2015) \"four-actions format\", a \"value curve\" or \"strategic contour\" can be derived for customers and the right balance found between adding and removing.\n\n---\n\n\n\"Four-actions format\"\n\n- Create: Which features should be added which were not part of the market or sector standard up to now?\n- Raise: Which feature should be significantly more distinct from the standard?\n- Reduce: Which feature should be significantly less distinct from the standard?\n- Eliminate: Which feature should be removed although it is part of the market or sector standard?\n\n\n# REDESIGN THE VALUE CURVE",
