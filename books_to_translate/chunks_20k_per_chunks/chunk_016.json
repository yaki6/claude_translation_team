The top manager talked enthusiastically about the new strategy that had evolved in collaboration with external consultants and was currently being implemented. It all sounded well thought-out, plausible given the company's situation at the time, and intrinsically coherent. As luck would have it, the co-author encountered a senior manager from the company's strategy department in the lobby after the meeting. They knew each other from before. The co-author said the CEO had just given him a presentation about the new corporate strategy. He got a surprising response: \"A new strategy? That's the first time I have heard of it...\" A few weeks later, two middle managers from the same company were attending a training event run by the co-author. Naturally, the co-author asked: \"So, how is the new strategy working out?\" Answer: \"What new strategy?\" Ponderous silence. \"Do you mean our new TV commercials, maybe?\"\n\n---\n\n\n# FROM DEVELOPMENT TO IMPLEMENTATION \n\nYou are currently in a transition phase from strategy development to implementation. This is a sore point in the strategy process because this is where the dynamics of the process change fundamentally. While you were always on top of the situation in the strategy development phase and could dictate the dramaturgy clearly for a manageable scope of people, the rules of the game are changing now. You should now have a clear idea about who you want to put into the picture, and how and when. But we have three pieces of good news before you start: Firstly, you already have familiarized politically important people with the process through elements like the qualitative interviews. Secondly, you have been continually updating your workforce in your communication on the first process steps about the progress of the process and sensitized them to the necessity of a new strategy and the change it entails. And thirdly, the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ provides you with a basis for your strategy narrative and an instrument for subsequent communication and persuasion.\n\n## COMMUNICATE THE OVERALL PICTURE\n\nStrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}=$ storyline\n\nIt is important that you communicate the overall picture. Instead of countless tedious PowerPoint slides, the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ presents your analysis results as well as the shared interpretations and decisions of the strategy team on the three pillars: \"Where do we stand?\", \"Where do we want to go?\" and \"What do we have to tackle?\" in a structured, clear, and contextualized format. This gives you the structure for the story you want to tell, the content for this story and the screenplay of how you want to tell your story. To borrow a movie phrase: The storyline is done. Now you have to answer the following questions: Who do you want to make enthusiastic about your strategy, and when, in what format, and with which core messages?\n\n## 1. ADAPT CONTENT \\& VISUALS\n\nExamine the content of the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ from this point of view: Is the strategy portrayed in a clear and comprehensible way to all involved or all affected? Are the selected formulations succinct?\n\nWill you thin out content some more to make the core of the strategy easier and better to grasp? For this, it can be helpful to visually adapt the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ to your corporate design, your corporate colors and your logo, or even to a strong motif for the background. However, you should keep the basic structure because this helps you make a compelling line of argument.\n\n---\n\n\n# 2. SELECT THE TARGET GROUPS AND TIMING \n\nDecide who in your organization and in your environment must be informed when, how and about what. You must involve stakeholder groups, committees, and individuals with a strong interest in and influence on your undertaking at an early stage and constantly bring them up to date. You should keep stakeholders who either have a strong interest but little influence or a strong influence but little interest informed about your progress.\n\n## 3. DEFINE THE CORE MESSAGES\n\nDetermine which core messages in the strategy are important to which target group. This will enable you to tailor the focus of your communication to each target group and the selected format.\n\n## 4. DECIDE THE EVENT FORMATS\n\nWhich formats do you want to use to bring each of the target groups up to speed: Supervisory or advisory board meeting, capital markets day, investor briefing, bank meeting, executive meeting (if you have not yet involved all management levels in the process), works council or staff meeting, or digital strategy summit on the web? Select the formats that suit your company and are sure to get the appropriate attention.\n\nIf the selected media and event formats are to function, you will need a wellcrafted dramaturgy. Ensure that information, dialog, and emotion are balanced. After all, you want to win over people to your plan. Information and explanation are indispensable if people are to understand your strategy. Dialog provides the opportunity to question and clarify what has been communicated. Set an emotional anchor that will convey the significance of the plan to the recipients of your strategy message through more than just \"blood, sweat and tears\" or a rationally driven line of argument. A very proficient guest speaker can work wonders here. If you think this type of support would make sense, make sure that this speaker establishes a link to your company's situation and to your strategy and does not merely reel off generalized motivational stories.\n\n---\n\n\n# 5. USE THE MEDIA \n\nIf you want to make your strategy known within your company and - if you wish - beyond it too, you should use what you have. And if you do not have much, this is the right time to build a clean media architecture within your company: intranet, employee newspaper, newsletters, videos. To help you make progress faster or as a complementary measure, you can of course avail of external communication in classic and social media as well.\n\n## 6. DISTRIBUTE THE STRATEGYFRAME ${ }^{\\circledR}$\n\nUse the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ in all formats as your visual anchor to prevent your audience from losing the thread. Visualize the connection for your employees between today - meaning your daily work routines - and the future expressed in the target vision. Distribute the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ to all employees and present it additionally at central locations in your company. Anything that is omnipresent will not disappear so lightly into a drawer.\n\n## 7. SET UP A CENTRAL PLATFORM\n\nSet up a central digital platform internally that displays the strategy content, process steps as well as the target and current states. This is for controlling the perception of success and particularly for creating transparency in project task completion and progress checks. To do this, you also have to cascade objectives, key results, and measures.\n\n## 8. BE VISIBLE\n\nPresenting a corporate strategy is the boss's job because there can be no strategy without leadership and no leadership without strategy. If you are not operating as a \"lone wolf\", then be sure to shine the stage lights on the other people involved in the strategy process as well. This will send a strong message that the entire management team supports the strategy.\n\n## 9. ANNOUNCE MILESTONES AND LIGHTHOUSE MEASURES\n\nIt is not enough to have a broadly-based but one-off communication drive. It is time for the next two process steps. You should set clear starting and finishing dates for \"cascading\" the objectives and key results in your corporate functions and business areas or regions. You should also communicate the starting date for the \"Transformation\" now already.\n\n---\n\n\n# COMMUNICATION PLANNING \n\nDATE\nTARGET GROUP\nCORE MESSAGES\nEVENT\nMEDIA\nPAYS INTO:\n1.

But you are not even halfway there when it comes to bringing your strategy to life. You will now start the strategy implementation process with the \"Cascade\" process step. After the Big Bang announcement \"We're realigning our company!\", a communication vacuum often develops if it is not immediately clear what that means and what the next steps will look like. You and your management team must now breathe life into your strategy tiger to ensure that it does not degenerate into a paper tiger in your day-to-day routines.\n\n## STUMBLING BLOCK NUMBER 1: IMPLEMENTATION!\n\nAccording to Sull et al. (2019), 67 percent of all corporate strategies fail because of a lack of competence in implementation. Momentive (2022) surveyed 1,750 decision-makers in companies with more than 1,000 employees in the USA, the UK and Australia about dealing with and experience of strategy. The findings are catastrophic: \"A sobering 9 out of 10 organizations fail to execute their strategy.\"\n\nThe reasons are manifold. However, the core of the problem is the difference in focus between the management level and the employees. Objectives are unclear, employees are frequently excluded from tracking the achievement of objectives (47 percent of all respondents). The frequency with which employees look at strategy varies from once a month ( 32 percent) to twice a year ( 30 percent), whereas 63 percent of top management executives look at strategy on a weekly basis. These are appalling figures if we think about the time and effort that was put into strategy development. But that is no reason to throw in your strategy towel.\n\n## GETTING YOUR POWER INTO IMPLEMENTATION MOTION\n\nThe most important thing you can do for your strategy - and the success of your company - and also the most difficult, is to put your plan into the hands of your management executives and employees. Many questions pop up around this, even after the best communication of the strategy using the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ : What does the strategy mean specifically to me? To my team? To my business area? How can we contribute to fulfilling the objectives? And what is my personal contribution?\n\n---\n\n\nThe \"cascading\" will provide the answers. The term, which is used in different spheres like IT, electricity generation, or management, means achieving a greater effect with modules arranged in a succession of stages than with only one individual module or with modules that are operating totally detached from each other. While the connection between the individual modules is unidirectional, you can still trace back the connection to the start of the chain.\n\nBut how do we set in motion this chain reaction that will ignite your strategy and carry it throughout your company like the Olympic torch? You have to break down the big picture in a way that makes it meaningful and understandable for employees' day-to-day work. The bigger and more complex your company is, the greater the time and human resources effort required to cascade your objectives and key results. Matrix organizations pose an even greater challenge still, as the following example from the corporate playing field shows.\n\n# STORIES FROM THE FIELD \n\nIt shows in practice: Few people have a real overview of what is going on in a company. We are not painting a black picture here; this is bitter company reality. An international customer from the mobility sector was working with us on honing their group strategy, including the definition of the most value-adding activities across all divisions, regions, and countries. The management board, all division and function heads as well as the regional P\\&L controllers were involved. After weeks of grappling with the right objectives, figures, and formulations, they proudly presented the adapted track out of the strategy crisis to the internal workforce as well as the external investor audience. Everyone was excited and swore to uphold the agreed objectives, including the abandonment of a historically important but no longer profitable product segment.\n\nBut what then showed up month after month in the company's financial figures, particularly in one key market, was unfortunately a far cry from the expectations that had been formulated. After the region heads had wrestled with the country management and opened an investigation, they noticed that a completely new product line had been constructed for precisely this unprofitable product segment. The project had swallowed up enormous financial resources for investments and still continued to operate consistently in the red. But it was precisely this product segment that had been discontinued, dismantled, or disposed of in all other countries based on the agreed new strategy.\n\n---\n\n\nThis example shows how important it is to cascade the strategy and the defined objectives correctly and to conduct progress checks for each objective. That is why you must lay the foundations you need for successful implementation. Do not let yourself be discouraged by complexity and effort to derive the objectives and key results from the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ through your entire company, fill them with specific leaders, measures, budgets and timelines, and make their implementation constantly measurable. This step is extremely important to your success.\n\n# 1. DEFINE YOUR CASCADE \n\nYou will now say that it is patently obvious how the cascade is supposed to go - it will simply follow our existing hierarchy, our org chart - from top to bottom. But if you look closely, that is not so trivial at all.\n\nWho will lead which cascade meeting with which hierarchy level and which number of participants? What is the time frame for when we should have penetrated into the farthest reaches of our company? How will we coordinate the objectives, key results and measures we have developed with the other teams on the horizontal level? Because in this phase it is not just about supporting the vertical team coordination on objectives and key results but also ensuring the horizontal coordination. Everyone will attempt to make their contribution, but maybe they won't be able to do it because they lack the support of another team. That promotes counterproductive silo mentalities. A good example of this would be support from the IT team for the digitalization of business areas or business units. You can have the most wonderful objectives that pay into the strategy, but if you do not synchronize them with the IT team, you will be waiting a long time for the implementation of your ambitious digital project. If objectives are not synchronized, there is a lack of resources and commitment. Frustration is high and the old familiar \"blame game\" begins.\n\nFor this reason, good, centralized planning and management of the strategy cascade rollout by the strategy process manager is a key success factor. Start the cascade for the overall undertaking with the two highest management levels 0 to 1 . In smaller companies, management and team leaders are sufficient if you have no further management levels. Start deriving the objectives and key results from the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ for one year and then for one quarter. Subsequently you should plan your management level 1 or your team leaders from the SME example with their \"direct reports\" (management level 2 or employees in the SME example). Ideally, you should continue to build the cascade further downward until you have reached every employee in your organization.\n\n---\n\n\nHowever, it is not always advisable to go down to the last operational level. In no way does that mean that these people do not deserve to be involved in the process. However, it is not necessary for the colleagues in the mail room or at reception, for example, to have this type of target system on their plates. You should also make sure that the individual groups in the cascade do not encompass more than 15 people because otherwise you cannot ensure active participation from all members, and some will adopt a consumption mindset. In this case, you should preferably divide up the group and conduct the group meeting twice. You should also check that no staff position holders or special functions fall through the grid and are therefore not taken into account.\n\n# SAMPLE CASCADE \n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\n---\n\n\n# 2. CREATE A CENTRAL PLATFORM \n\nThere is no doubt that, when it comes to breaking down objectives and regularly checking progress, there is no dearth of clever recommendations from the OKR method world and numerous tracking software solutions. There is something to suit everyone's taste: from intelligent PowerPoint to programmed Excel tables and beyond. Here, too, the trick is not to overdo it with the reporting, tracking, and controlling and nevertheless being able to observe the progress of the implementation on a central basis that is transparent to everyone. To do this, you have to consider various needs and wants:\n\n- Corporate management will want to always retain an overview of the progress of the implementation, resource expenditure and the value contribution of the various activities right across the company, in order to be able to intervene if necessary, especially if financial problems arise.\n- Those responsible for the strategy process must on the one hand maintain the \"dashboard\" for the overview and on the other hand ensure the activation of the employees involved through their executives. At the same time, they have to synchronize the set objectives and ensure they are consistently tracked. Therefore, the process managers do not just need a good overview, but also a detailed perspective.\n- The executives responsible for the implementation must communicate the message of the new strategy consistently, derive the objectives for their teams and fill them out with feasible measures. From this point on, they will be under pressure and will have to show their hand with regard to the realization of the set objectives.\n- The employees will want to know first and foremost what contribution to the realization of the objectives is expected of them and how they are supposed to handle the topics and tasks allocated to them alongside their daily business under the pressure of regular reporting and full transparency of individual performance.\n\nThis initial situation is definitely not an easy one if you remember that it is still about people who are supposed to populate software tools with data and results without feeling as if someone is looking over their shoulder all the time.\n\nWe therefore recommend using the project management instruments that are already available in the company and combining them with existing or new communication systems. The key word here is acceptance of the technical solution. If your employees have acceptance problems with new technical solutions, there\n\n---\n\n\nis a danger that they will transfer this problem orientation onto their attitude to the new strategy and the entire process. Put the onus on your management team to explain the purpose of new tools to their own employees and to ask them individually about the implementation progress. It pays to take the time to do this. What is important is that you have the right direction and sentiment for your project.\n\n# 3. CONDUCT STRATEGIC DIALOGS",
