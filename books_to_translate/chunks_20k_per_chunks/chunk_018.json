SHOWCASE THEM INDEPENDENTLY OF THE CURRENT STATUS OF DISCUSSIONS IN INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVES OR PROJECTS.\n\nThe credibility of the dual operating system depends to a large extent on whether it delivers visible and impactful results fast enough. Human patience is limited, especially among those who are in a state of psychological uncertainty and are afraid that they will be in the losing camp at the end of the transformation. The\n\n---\n\n\nlonger it takes, the easier it is for sceptics, whiners, and saboteurs to dilute achievements and erect obstacles. That is why you should celebrate milestones and all the successes that pay into your target vision. Use every type of communication on internal and external media to do this. Success inspires and emotionalizes. Take the people in your organization on board emotionally.\n\n# 5. DON'T GIVE UP! CONTINUE TO LEARN FROM EXPERIENCES. DON'T DECLARE VICTORY TOO SOON. \n\nYou have to implement your strategic initiative within the action areas and constantly create new ones to adapt to a changing business environment and stay competitive. If you take your foot off the gas, the process loses its momentum and gives resistance lots of space to develop.\n\nThat is the crucial reason why the situation analysis and its accompanying challenges are so central to the urgency of your strategy process. The only thing that keeps people moving is what is important and simultaneously urgent. If the urgency is too weak at the beginning or is neglected, the determination in the strategic network swiftly declines and the focus shifts back to the hierarchy.\n\n## 6. INSTITUTIONALIZE STRATEGIC CHANGES IN YOUR ORGANIZATION'S CULTURE.\n\nStrategic initiatives have not been completed until they have been transferred and integrated into daily routines. For that reason, you should not just embed factual results from the gradual execution of the defined work packages. Every initiative brings new requirements and challenges for the thoughts and actions of the participants. Shared learning and retraining as well as sharing the learnings with others in the organization generate new organizational knowledge that can be used creatively and innovatively for the company's competitiveness. Continuous strategic learning (Pietersen, 2001) will change your organization and create a culture of openness to new things, agility in thoughts and actions, and sustainability of action.\n\n---\n\n\n# TRANSFORM \n\nTo implement your strategy, you must now transform your entire organization one step at a time. You have already laid the foundation for this in all action areas in the \"Adapt\" process step, and more important measures were added on the various team levels in your company in \"Cascade\". Now set the transformation in motion with the six strategy accelerators and get it up to the required speed.\n\n## KEY QUESTIONS:\n\n1. How should we start the transformation to generate lasting change?\n2. How will we overcome obstacles and resistance in the existing hierarchy?\n3. Who will be members of the transformation steering committee - the core transformation team?\n4. How will we activate previously unused powers within the entire organization and shape these into a strategic network?\n5. How will we create the necessary communication infrastructure and content to accelerate the journey?\n6. How can we establish strong symbols for the urgency of change as well as for our impact statement?\n7. How will we embed the systemic changes into structures and processes?\n8. How will we inspire the people in the organization and incite them to actively join us on the journey?\n\n## INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Start the application and selection process for the strategy community and the transformation steering committee.\n2. Decide on dates for the inaugural meeting of the steering committee as well as for the meeting and reporting routine.\n3. Ensure synchronization with the strategy cascade and its routines.\n4. Launch the strategy network with clear rules of play and with your backing.\n5. Develop a viable, multidirectional infrastructure and content structure for your communication and the interaction within the network.\n6. Develop an exciting dramaturgy along the change curve to showcase successes and to inspire.\n\n## TIPS\n\nAppointment recommendations for the guiding coalition (transformation steering committee):\n\n- Sponsor of the strategy process\n- Strategy process manager\n- Sponsor of the five objectives\n- Five representatives from the strategic network from all hierarchical levels and corporate areas (if possible also diverse with regard to gender, age, nationality, ...)\nRestrict the group to 12 members, as otherwise the dynamism will be lost because of the size of the group.\n\nAppointment to the strategic network: Combine suggestions from the existing hierarchy with an open internal application process that includes a motivational letter or video. When you are appointing the network members, make sure you cover all regional, functional, and operational areas of your company.\n\n## CAUTION\n\nExperience shows that it is generally the good, popular (agreeable) and willing employees who are proposed for important working groups or pilot projects. But time is the scarcest of all resources. Generally, these usual suspects are already excessively busy with day-to-day business and in other projects along the strategy cascade. You must therefore give the network sufficient time resources and relieve them of other tasks. Your networkers should be able to use at least 20 to 40 percent of their work time for the transformation. Alongside suggestions, you should also let the colleagues' initiative decide.\n\n---\n\n\n# TRANSFORMATION STEERING COMMITTEE\n\n## MEMBERS:\n\n**Strategy sponsor:**

OPENNESS CURIOSITY, ENTHUSIASM\n\n---\n\n\n# \"THE REASON WHY IT IS SO DIFFICULT FOR EXISTING FIRMS TO CAPITALIZE ON DISRUPTIVE INNOVATIONS IS THAT THEIR PROCESSES AND THEIR BUSINESS MODEL THAT MAKE THEM GOOD AT THE EXISTING BUSINESS ACTUALLY MAKE THEM BAD AT COMPETING FOR THE DISRUPTION.\" \n\nClayton M. Christensen, US economist, author, and management consultant\n\n---\n\n\n# EXPERIMENT \n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\n---\n\n\n# GROWTH ENGINE FOR THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW \n\n\"Experimentation can be defined as an iterative process of learning, what does and does not work. The goal of a business experiment is actually not a product or solution; it is learning - the kind of learning about customers, markets, and possible options that will lead you to the right solution.\"\nDavid L. Rogers, consultant, author and faculty member for Digital Strategy \\& Marketing, Columbia Business School.\n\nYou are using the current strategy process to reorient your company with an eye to the future. You want to maximize competitiveness and resilience. But strategy execution is still an experiment. On the one hand, your strategy will contain new elements and you do not know yet today how they will function internally or for the customer tomorrow. On the other hand, you are not rolling out your strategy in a vacuum, but under competitive pressure in an environment that is constantly changing.\n\nFor example, if your strategy envisages a more aggressive price and sales policy to increase your share in a particular market, you will be attacking your competitors directly. They could then react aggressively and lower their prices to defend their market position. Lower prices please the customers but reduce corporate profits. But your competitors could also fight back in a different market where you are reliant on a higher price level for profitability reasons. Therefore, when you transform, do not just hope for the best, as the title of our book suggests, presuming that, \"It will all work out\".\n\nYour company - like us all - is a part of diverse systems that overlap and compete from the micro to the macro level. Therefore, your activities do not just produce results where you would like, they can also lead to unexpected consequences in other parts of a system. That is why it is important to identify systemic interactions between your strategy elements, understand their nature and assess their implications. You can reduce your implementation risk by testing out critical strategy elements (for instance, new price offers) gradually and iteratively (for example, in different, clearly demarcated test markets).\n\nIf the experimentation is successful, is that as good as it gets? Of course not, because the old footballer's adage applies: There is always a next game. The next disruption could already lie in wait at the next trade fair or come from the next start-up. So, continue your thought process: Which capabilities and resources are already in your company that you could use to develop the growth engine for the day after tomorrow. Now you might retort: \"Yes, that is all well and good, but just let us finish up the current strategy process first.\"\n\nYes, you should always finish what you started, but in case you have not noticed yet, there is no end to the process when you make it your new strategic routine.\n\n---\n\n\nAnd in this routine of constantly reviewing and adjusting, the question about the growth engine for the day after tomorrow will automatically come up. Irrespective of where the next disruption comes from or what forces are driving it, the best way to be prepared, conquer your challenges and dominate new growth areas is, according to Anthony et al. (2017), a \"dual transformation\":\n\"Dual transformation is the greatest challenge a leadership team will ever face. It is also the greatest opportunity a leadership team will encounter.\"\n\n# DUAL TRANSFORMATION FORMULA \n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nThe A stands for the strategy process that you are currently going through. Of course, there are sufficient topics in this process that you can test gradually and sparingly before or during the implementation. Experimentation promotes learning. And if you want to still be relevant and successful the day after tomorrow, you should consider that you might have to generate your future growth outside the core business depicted in A. If you have already decided on one of the three strategic courses of action\n\n- Identification of value offerings\n- Market identification\n- Future diversification\nin the target vision when you were determining the playing field, you will find the instructions for developing it here.\n\n---\n\n\n# CREATE THE GROWTH ENGINE $=\\mathrm{B}$ \n\nSearching for new markets, new demand and new business models is a major strategic challenge that you have to face with farsightedness, openness in your thought processes and agility in your actions. Overcoming this challenge generally requires new resources and skills as well as a different approach compared to your established markets. In addition, the future field of activity can look completely different to the current one. For this reason, we have uncoupled the duality process step from reorienting core business in A in the first run.\n\nBusiness model innovation is one option for strategically developing a company. Instead of letting yourself be \"creatively destroyed\" or made irrelevant by others, you \"destroy\" your current business model in good time and establish a new one. Real-world experience shows that \"creative self-destruction\" seldom works when \"the house is on fire\", your core business is no longer watertight, and the strategy crisis is consuming all your energy. Furthermore, it is difficult to develop something new within the boundaries of the existing organization. That is why companies frequently split off exploratory initiatives from regular company business into independent units (for example, innovation labs).\n\nIf you want to go down this road, you will need a team that has skills, horizons of experience and personalities that will be able to not just think \"out of our own box\" but \"beyond the boxes\". This means having strategic foresight as well as understanding trends and developments on the macro and micro levels. If you want to build your future growth engine, you will need investments and stable financial resources. And no one knows whether anything usable will come out of the future lab. There are no guarantees, but a multitude of risks. That means that you will have to convince those in your company who tend to prefer lower risk about the search for the future engine and the rationale of the associated use of scarce resources.\n\n## HOW DO YOU FIND YOUR B?\n\nNew business models are usually born when new business opportunities are recognized in a market on the supply or demand side. The founders of Netflix cancelled out Blockbusters' stationary movie lending business when they recognized that the new DVD technology was ideally suited for mailing. Additionally, Amazon provided them with a functioning model for mail order. The combination of new technology and new sales approach created a new business model. Similarly,\n\n---\n\n\nthe business models used by Uber, Airbnb and other digital intermediaries are based on the realization that supply and demand can be coordinated better and profitably, or even created from scratch, with the help of technology.\n\nHow should you proceed? You have to identify problems, weaknesses or defects in your potential focus markets which have not been addressed, or not adequately addressed, up to now because specialized skills were lacking, potential solutions are too expensive or inconvenient under current conditions or customers cannot yet imagine better solutions. Your first task now is to find better, cheaper or more convenient solutions. After that, you will develop a business model that overcomes existing barriers, serves the market profitably and can ensure your future. Examine the various options for getting your new business model to the starting line, for example, the establishment of a new company, a spin-off from the current company, acquisitions or participations in established companies or startups.\n\n# DISCOVER UNIQUE CAPABILITIES $=\\mathbf{C}$",
