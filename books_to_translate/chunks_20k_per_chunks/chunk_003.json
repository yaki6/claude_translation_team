There is truly no lack of methods and instruments on the topic of strategy in relevant management books, trade magazines, and on the internet.\n\nAnd the BCG Matrix, Porter's industry structure analysis (Five Forces), the Balanced Scorecard, PESTEL, CAGE, SWOT, Blue Ocean, or even the Business Canvas Model only form the tip of the iceberg. Why does the world of strategic company management need yet another strategy tool? Is the existing toolset not enough? Must we repeatedly sell the old wine in new wineskins?\n\nThese are the critical questions we asked ourselves too when we were developing our StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ and ultimately when we were writing this book. Of course, the well-known tools have their justification in their respective areas of application, but unfortunately, they don't entirely meet the fundamental needs of today's strategists and their organizations. One deployment of these strategy tools, generally combined with elaborate Excel tables and extensive PowerPoint presentations, does not make a \"strategy summer\". Therefore, many strategy executives have a difficult time finding the right way to develop and implement a coherent and activating corporate strategy. After months of grueling strategy work alongside daily business operations, their enthusiasm and momentum have fallen by the wayside, and in the end, they are disappointed with the results.\n\nFrom our work with strategy executives in both small and medium-sized companies as well as in large corporations, we know the questions that are on their minds:\n\nWhat questions do you have?\n\n- Which strategic thought and operational framework is the right one for us? Which elements does it comprise?\n- How should we proceed methodically in developing and implementing our strategy?\n- How can we execute the various elements of the strategy process efficiently and effectively?\n- How do we create acceptance for the strategy we have developed?\n\n---\n\n\nThese strategy practitioner's needs are what drove us to develop a simple, workable tool for the strategy process, from the formulation of a strategy right up to its implementation. The StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ combines and visualizes the key elements of strategy work into one overall picture that gives context, content, process, and maybe even emotional orientation and clarity to all involved and to all stakeholders. Across its three core modules, the key fundamental questions what must we know, what must we decide, and what must we do - are answered.\n\n# THE THREE CORE MODULES \n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\n---\n\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\n# SITUATION ANALYSIS \n\nIt involves analyzing your company's situation in its current action areas, identifying potential new areas, and understanding the external environment. Answers must be found to the following questions: Where is your greatest potential in the \"market\"? Which markets are you addressing? What are the needs of the \"customers\" and how are they changing? Who are the \"competition\"? Which \"trends\" are changing your industry? What is happening in the \"broader environment\"? What do your \"own realities\" look like? And finally: Which \"challenges\" emerge for your company?\n\n| CUSTOMERS | MARKET | COMPETITION |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| TRENDS | BROADER ENVIRONMENT | OWN REALITIES |\n| CHALLENGE |  |  |\n\n---\n\n\n# TARGET VISION \n\nIn the second core module, you will develop the \"focus\" of your corporate strategy on four target levels:\n\n## 1. IMPACT\n\nIn your \"impact statement\" you will stipulate how your company aims to achieve a sustainable effect for business, the environment, and society.\n\n## 2. CUSTOMER BENEFIT \\& SUPERIOR PROFITS\n\nYour distinguishing \"customer benefit\" will clarify what your company intends to do better than or different from the competition, and thus generate \"superior profits\" so that you are a step ahead of the competition.\n\n## 3. PLAYING FIELD\n\nThe key component of your focusing process is marking out the playing fields for your company. Which \"target markets\" do you want to be active in? Which \"customer segments\" do you want to address with which \"offerings\"? Which competitors are you entering the ring against?\n\n## 4. PRIORITIES\n\nWhen you define your \"goals\" and \"key results\", you define what is on the schedule in which order for your company. In this context, objectives and key results can be motivated by both quantitative and qualitative factors.\n\n## IMPACT STATEMENT\n\n## CUSTOMER BENEFIT\n\n## TARGET MARKETS\n\n## CUSTOMER SEGMENTS\n\n## OBJECTIVES\n\n## SUPERIOR PROFITS\n\n## CUSTOMER SEGMENTS\n\n## KEY RESULTS\n\n---\n\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\n# ACTION AREAS \n\nOnce your target vision has been determined, the next task is realizing it. What actions do you and your team have to take within the company? Which \"structures \\& processes\" are necessary? How can \"data \\& IT\" be optimally utilized in the digital age? Which \"people\" with which skills does your company need? Which \"culture\" will unleash the power for \"innovations\"? Which strategic \"partners\" could help you to achieve your goals?\n\nIf your corporate strategy aims to impact various business units, geographies, and functional areas, you can specify the expected value contribution of the individual units at this stage.\n\nTo ensure that your strategy does not remain a mere declaration of intent, you should draw up a \"timetable\" for its implementation and for the transformation of your company. It will determine the \"control\" of timing and content, how the strategy will be \"cascaded\" through the individual business units, geographies, and functional areas, and which \"dramaturgy\" you would like to use for your actions in the various phases.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nROADMAP\n\n---\n\n\n# A COMMON UNDERSTANDING \n\nIf you don't have a common vision of what is possible when you pursue a common strategy, it won't work. If you don't set out for the future from a common basis, your strategy work will involve a lot of friction losses and misunderstandings and therefore will not be very effective.\n\nThe modular StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ provides clarity and an overview of all the elements that must be taken into account in strategy work. It helps identify potential gaps in strategic considerations, consolidates insights gained, makes the decisive points of the strategy directly visible to everyone in the company and does not hide them behind a gazillion PowerPoint slides. When you use the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$, you will never lose sight of the overall context during the strategy process, but you will nonetheless get enough space to dive into the necessary details to gain true perspective.\n\nThus, the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ acts as an organizational content platform for strategy development, whether for the initial or the regular strategy meeting, or for the annual review and adjustment of the strategy. At the same time, it can be used as a visual instrument for communicating with and involving employees or other stakeholders (investors, banks).\n\n---\n\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\n# **SITUATION ANALYSIS**\n\n|  CUSTOMERS | MARKET | COMPETITION  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n|  |   |   |\n\n\n---\n\n\n# ACTION AREAS \n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\n---\n\n\n# STRATEGY WORKFLOW \n\n## LEARNING AT THE MOMENT OF APPLICATION\n\n\"Learning is most effective in the doing. That is why the work process is an excellent place to learn. Performance support or workflow learning with a digital coach offer customized learning and support at the precise time when they are needed.\" Oliver Kern, Performance Support Expert\n\nBe honest: How many of the management books on your shelves have you actually read? How many of those were genuinely helpful to you in solving your business challenges? And which content and insights can you still remember one year later? In each case, the number is likely to be manageably low.\n\nThe 70:20:10 model sums it up as a simple formula: Developed in the 1980s by management researchers McCall, Lombardo, and Eichinger, the model demonstrates that we gain around 70 percent of our professional knowledge by daily \"learning and doing on the job\", while some 20 percent of our knowledge stems from colleagues and other people. Further training measures of all types (like traditional seminars or e-learning) contribute only 10 percent. The mere availability of attractive sources of knowledge is not enough for managers to actually use these purposefully. Time is a scarce and precious resource that no one willingly spends on dry knowledge transfer.\n\nInstead, we have experienced that effective learning becomes manifest in its application and in the resulting experience gained. Comparable to how a flight simulator is used to train pilots, we use software-based simulations, for example, to train decision-making capacity and to test the consequences of strategic and operational decisions. Nothing sticks better in our minds than what we try out and experience ourselves.\n\nToday, we live in an era of information overload. More data is available than ever before. We are increasingly using artificial intelligence to channel the flow of data, to process data, and to interpret data. Despite the support of digital automation, strategy executives have to filter out the information that is relevant for decisions. What must be analyzed, thought through, discussed, and agreed, when and how, in the strategy process? It is easy to lose your overview in this process. Then information overload turns into brain overload, and overview turns into tunnel vision.\n\nLearning experts Gottfredson and Mosher (2010) categorized the five moments of need in learning. \"Learning something new\" (01) and \"Learning more about something\" (02) are among the moments of need in \"formal learning\". Knowledge transfer in formal learning takes place first and foremost through\n\n---\n\n\ntraditional methods like seminars, as well as e-learning in the form of online training courses.\n\nAdditionally, there are three moments of need that pertain to implementing what has been learned: \"Using or remembering something\" (03), \"When a problem arises\" (04) or \"When something changes\" (05).\n\nThe additional moments of need generally arise from the workflow. This is our starting point.\n\n# OUR WORKFLOW \n\nWe want you to maintain the overview in the strategy process and also have perspective. You will see both the wood and the trees. The basis of our StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ is the idea of learning at the moment of application. That is why we have structured our strategy process as a \"workflow\". The StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ is designed in such a way that you can provide the \"right\" resources for your strategy work at the \"right\" time in the \"right\" amount of content in digestible form and on cascading instruction levels. For this reason, we have not geared and prepared this content along the lines of specialist topics, but instead we have classified them into specific individual tasks that you have to complete during the strategy process. Thus, you receive the relevant support right at your moment of need.\n\nOur workflow comprises eight action steps you should take in the strategy process. We explain the necessity of each process step and give you a real instruction manual to work through with key questions, tips, examples, and tools. However, the workflow is not a one-way street. You will work through the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ several times across the workflow.\n\nProcess steps:\n\n1. Plan\n2. Analyze\n3. Focus\n4. Adapt\n5. Cascade\n6. Transform\n7. Experiment\n8. Adjust\n\n---\n\n\n# **STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT**\n\n## **2. ANALYZE**\n\n## **3. FOCUS**\n\n## **4. ADAPT**\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\n## **5. CASCADE**\n\n## **6.

ADJUST\n\nRegularly challenge and sharpen the strategy.\n\n---\n\n\n# \"I LOVE IT WHEN A PLAN COMES TOGETHER.\" \n\nHannibal Smith, The A-Team\n\n---\n\n\n# PLAN \n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\n---\n\n\n# PLAN YOUR STRATEGY PROCESS RIGHT \n\n## WHERE TO START\n\nThe first question is obvious: Can we do it ourselves? A strategy process that is going to succeed requires very good planning, and the participants have to enjoy doing it too. Without a well-thought-out plan and enjoyment of the process, the strategy process will quickly turn into a time-consuming, non-motivating event that feels like a burden, with little engagement among many participants and little to show as result. Then maybe it would be better to hire a consultancy firm after all? Will they let loose on us with \"fancy\" methods, take a sledgehammer to crack a nut? After countless rounds of interviews, will we be sticking Post-its onto boards with our colleagues in a series of workshops? Will we be overwhelmed in the end by an avalanche of number-crunching Excel sheets and tightly packed PowerPoint slides? And then what will we do with them? Unfortunately, this is frequently the reality companies face when they undertake strategy development!\n\nAre you disheartened? Is it too much effort for too little return? And your nerves are rubbed raw on top of that? Are you now veering towards the anti-strategists' camp after all - just do what you can, only even better than before? Then a strategy won't be necessary? Or will it? We will support you on your journey of self-discovery. If you are not engaged, tweaking your future won't work. There is a lot to consider before you throw yourself into the work. But that does not mean it has to be deadly serious either.\n\nDevelop your own strategy\n\nThe next step is about the big picture: How do you plan a really good strategy process? How do you manage to make the process enjoyable alongside your day-to-day business? What questions do you have to answer before you start the process? We will provide you with a handbook to enable you to avoid problems that frequently arise in the development process or to think of solutions to them right from the start.\n\n## CALL A SPADE A SPADE\n\n\"In the beginning was the Word,\" the Gospel of John says. The word \"strategy\" is often avoided at the beginning of change processes for internal reasons, because it is considered to be unclear, overused or pretentious. People prefer to talk about an annual review, reorientation, or new mission. The word \"mission\" in particular has a ring of new departures to it and banks on the CEO as Chief Evangelist, the lead missionary to fire up markets and customers.\n\nAll too often, strategy is equated to or confused with formulating objectives, for example, \"We want to increase our profits by 10 percent every year.\"\n\n---\n\n\nCome again? Why not by 50 percent? Or why increase at all?\nBut objectives are not a strategy, they are not implementable instructions - just desired results. Objectives stem from our ambitions, wishes and intentions. The crucial question in strategy development is not which objectives you want to aim for, but which challenges does your company face and what opportunities for development are available. Strategy isn't a bowl of cherries. It is your idea for how you can overcome these challenges and capitalize on the opportunities. The desired objectives are then derived from the challenges and opportunities.\n\nThis is your first assignment: Provide clarity. Call a spade a spade. Together with your management team and everyone who is supposed to contribute to the success of your strategy, develop a shared understanding of what strategy should be and what it should do. This brings us to the fundamental questions you will have to answer before starting any proposed change process:\n\n# \\#1: WHICH AREA OF YOUR COMPANY SHOULD THE STRATEGY BE DEVELOPED FOR? \n\n## FOR...\n\n## ...THE ENTIRE COMPANY = CORPORATE STRATEGY:\n\nThe first and farthest-reaching area of application spans the entire company or all parts of a group of companies. We are then talking about corporate or group strategy. It determines where, when and how the company's resources are to be deployed to overcome the challenges that were identified and capitalize on available opportunities. Put simply, it is about defining and staking out the playing fields: Which markets and sectors does the company want to be active in? Which synergies can be created in a portfolio that consists of different products, services, and geographies?\n\n## ... A BUSINESS AREA = BUSINESS AREA STRATEGY:\n\nLarger companies generally have several business areas that require individual strategies within the overall context of a corporate strategy because of their distinctiveness. The business area strategy determines how the diagnosed challenges and opportunities should be tackled in the specific field of activity and how the business area wants to position itself against the competition.\n\n## ... FOR FUNCTIONAL AREAS = FUNCTIONAL AREA STRATEGY:\n\nThe third organizational area of application pertains to functional areas of a company, such as procurement, production, marketing, distribution, financing, or personnel. In this area, the primary focus is on the integration of the individual functional areas to make a value contribution to the company's envisaged success.\n\n---\n\n\nFunctional strategies cannot be established in isolation. Instead, they have to be coordinated with the overarching strategy areas \"business area\" and \"company/ group\" and contribute to their success. This can be seen from the current topics of \"digital transformation\" with the functional area IT as a center of gravity, or \"sustainability\", which particularly concerns the company areas of production, procurement, and logistics in manufacturing companies (for example, with the aim of reducing their \"carbon footprint\").\n\n# ...REGIONS = GLOBAL, MULTINATIONAL OR LOCAL STRATEGY: \n\nAlongside the organizational dimension of strategy, there is also the geographic area of application. Companies that operate internationally usually have a global corporate or group strategy into which the local business area strategies for different geographic markets are subsumed (\"glocalization\").\n\n## STORIES FROM THE FIELD\n\nSports and leisure goods manufacturer Adidas, for example, pursues this type of approach (2022).\n\nThe corporate strategy it calls \"own the game\" focuses on credibility, consumer experience and sustainability. It is designed to be implemented through continuous innovation and digitalization. The strategic markets, aka regions, are China, North America and EMEA. For each of these regions, Adidas has a \"tailored approach that picks up on local trends\" with the aim of \"gaining market share in all three strategic markets.\"",
