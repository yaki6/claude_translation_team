If strategists take time out to think, they need other people to look after the day-to-day routine and keep the business running. That's why we are firmly convinced that strategy making is teamwork. And teamwork always works when we follow a shared target vision.\n\nWriting a book is teamwork too - but not so much, because this book has two authors with a shared target vision. Instead, we would not have been capable of putting our thoughts, experiences, and insights to digital paper if we hadn't had many supporters who shared our target vision, took over our tiresome daily routines and necessities patiently and indulgently during the writing phase and inspired, motivated and corrected us sympathetically.\n\n---\n\n\nTO OUR TEAM, WITHOUT ANY CHRONOLOGY OR PRIORITY, BUT WITH HEARTFELT THANKS AND HUMILITY:\n\nWILLIE PIETERSEN, Retired C-Suite executive, Professor of Practical Management at Columbia Business School, inventor of the Strategic Learning Cycle and a source of inspiration to us to think strategy as a learning task and in its practical application for people.
