  "source_text": "After a long period of pandemic conditions, workshops with in-person attendance are highly popular again. Rightly so. Discussions proceed much more dynamically without mute/unmute, sensitivities and emotions are much easier to read, and the coffee breaks can fulfil their important role as catalysts again. However, that does not mean that digital is no longer possible. We designed many successful fully-digital formats in the pandemic years. Naturally, the time and effort for preparation as well as the costs of a digital \"hook-up\" are significantly lower than a strategy workshop in the countryside with overnight stay, catering, and so on. But be sure to avoid hybrid workshops in which only some of the participants attend in person, while the others join online. This balancing act either works badly, or not at all. Your strategy workshop deteriorates in terms of spontaneity, dynamism, and productivity.\n\nAvoid hybrid formats\nWhen it comes to the physical venue, you should ensure you choose a pleasant environment with an inspirational atmosphere. The typical business hotels in major cities have suitable conference room facilities. However, we have seldom felt inspiration in such places. Unusual locations far removed from the classic business hotel scene can stimulate reflection. When selecting your conference room in the selected venue, you should avoid rooms with large, unmovable tables and unwieldy seating. You only need a room that is a basic, practical square box - and therefore has enough space to be furnished flexibly and is equipped with adequate and functioning whiteboards and digital presentation surfaces.\n\n---\n\n\n# \\#5: WHO WILL BE MODERATING THE STRATEGY WORKSHOP? \n\nThe workshop moderator can be someone from among your own ranks or someone external. It should be a personality who will be noticed and accepted for both their demeanor and their communication because as moderator they have to simultaneously motivate, provoke, and objectify without letting the workshop participants \"steal the show\". Do you have a personality like this in your ranks? If you do, then make sure that this person has a résumé and sufficient experience within the company to be acceptable to the participants, is not professionally blinkered and is a generalist rather than a specialist. With the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ for support, this person should then be able to lead the workshop.\n\nAlternatively, you could bring in someone from the outside. This has the advantage of impartiality and neutrality. An external moderator can address and verbalize things - the \"elephant in the room\" - that could be difficult for an internal moderator to do. Of course, in this scenario too, personality and experience are important. We have personalities on our Strategy Makers team who are familiar with the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\\circledR}$ and are able to moderate your strategy workshop.\n\n---\n\n\n# STRATEGY WORKSHOP I \n\nBefore you start the workshop, you should be able to answer \"Yes\" to these three questions:\n$\\square$ Have you completed the situation analysis?\n$\\square$ Have you invited all the participants to the workshop?\n$\\square$ Were all workshop participants involved in the situation analysis (interview, module processing, etc.)?\nOr did you share the key questions from the individual modules in the situation analysis with them?\nNow you can jump into the detailed planning of the workshop with the following key questions and draw up an agenda:\n\n## KEY QUESTIONS:\n\n1. What is the objective of the strategy workshop?\n2. How long should the strategy workshop take and what should the schedule entail?\n3. Who should participate in the strategy workshop?\n4. Where will the strategy workshop be held?\n5. Who will be moderating the strategy workshop?\n\n## KEY FIGURES:\n\nFor 1. OBJECTIVE:\n\nFor 2. DURATION:\n\nFor 3. PARTICIPANTS:\n\nFor 4.

PRESENTATION OF THE SITUATION ANALYSIS\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nNot all workshop participants were involved to the same extent in conducting and evaluating the situation analysis. For that reason, you must first bring all participants up to speed. Present the results of the situation analysis from the \"Environment\" (Customers, Market, Competition, Trends, and Broader environment) as well as the \"Own realities\" modules. Start with providing an \"objective\" portrayal of the module results without incorporating your own insights and interpretations. This way, you will avoid triggering anchoring effects among the participants. We recommend that you present the quantitative and qualitative results for each module together to create a thematic association. This will make it easier for you to demonstrate deviations or correlations between the forms of analysis and with various topic areas.\n\n---\n\n\n# LOOK IN THE MIRROR \n\nWhen you are presenting the results, do not underestimate the emotional reactions of the group or of individual participants. There will be critical queries (\"What is the data set employed in this analysis?\") or even resistance (\"That can't be right. I don't believe that. We'll have to check that again.\") or conflicting opinions (\"Who said that? I see that totally differently!\").\nParticularly when it comes to your own realities, emotions regularly tend to run high. When this happens, keep a cool head. Explain the analyses and present their results in their full definition and brutality. That is painful, but absolutely necessary, because otherwise you won't create the notorious \"sense of urgency\" among the participants to set the process of change in motion. After all, you did not start the strategy process so that everything stays the same in the end and nothing changes. As Einstein famously said: The purest form of insanity is to leave everything as it is and hope something will change.\"\n\n## DIGEST BITTER TRUTHS\n\nFor this reason, we recommend that you only present the results on the first half-day of the workshop, without any interpretations or conclusions. Some participants will need a little time to digest the results and assimilate them in a reflection process. Then the participants can discuss them at length during the group dinner or later, in the bar. Some people may find that this continues to reverberate throughout the night and gives them a disturbed sleep. But that is all part and parcel of a successful workshop dramaturgy. In this way, you will avoid hasty emotional reactions the next day when the task is to formulate the insights and develop a shared understanding.\n\n## GUIDANCE\n\n1. Attach the module cards from the situation analysis to a pinboard or magnetic whiteboard.\n2. Present the results one module at a time.\n3. You can always add further information (in paper form for the pinboard or in the digital format you are using). This enables a clear overall picture to develop.\n4. Schedule sufficient time after each module for questions.\n\n---\n\n\n# 2.

Your situation analyis comprises figures, data, facts and statements that have been condensed into results. Now you and your team have to process, understand and interpret these results together and draw conclusions from them. When you are formulating the insights you have agreed on, every single word matters.\n\n# INSTRUCTIONS \n\nThe way you conduct the formulation process depends on the number of workshop participants:\n\n2 to 4 participants: Formulate with the entire group\n6 to 8 participants: Formulate in two breakout groups of 3 to 4 participants\n9 to 12 participants: Formulate in three breakout groups of 3 to 4 participants\n\nProceed module by module. If the participants are split up into breakout groups, each group will work on one module. Use brainwriting as a technique to support the formulation process.\n\nBrainwriting: Each participant individually thinks about the topic and jots down thoughts, observations or suggestions on a notepad or flipchart. You can now use the 6-3-5 method to filter the insights. How does the method work? Each of the six participants writes down three insights and passes them on to the other five participants one after the other. Each participant then adds to their predecessor's insights. You can adjust the 6-3-5 method to the number of your workshop participants.\n\n---\n\n\n# PROCEDURE \n\n1. Before you start the 6-3-5 rounds, you should clarify the key questions for the module again.\n2. Each participant writes down three insights per round on the worksheet. A round should take no more than 5 minutes or end as soon as all participants have listed their three insights.\n3. When the round ends, each participant passes their worksheet on to their neighbor (for example, in a clockwise direction). A new round begins now: Each of the participants then adds another three ideas to the worksheet they received. The ideas listed already can be used as inspiration and elaborated, but totally new ideas are also allowed.\n4. Repeat step 3, until all participants have written on every worksheet (so if you have six participants, that means after a total of six rounds).\n5. Each breakout group then puts the gathered insights on a whiteboard or flipchart. Let each participant select their two most important insights and mark them with sticky dots. Discuss and derive the group's five key insights.\n6. The insights of the breakout groups are then presented, discussed and supplemented in a plenary session.\n7. Finally, the insights are evaluated again using two sticky dots for each participant and put into a ranking order from this process.\n8. The moderator transfers the final results to each module card for the situation analysis.\n\n## FORMULATION TIP\n\nAvoid specialized jargon, formulate your insights precisely in a way that everyone can understand. You will find formulation examples on the worksheets for the individual modules in the previous chapter. In the aftermath of the workshop, you can fine-tune the formulations in discussions with all participants.\n\n---\n\n\n# CHALLENGES \n\n## OVERCOME STRATEGIC OBSTACLES\n\n\"There is nothing like a challenge to bring out the best in man.\"\nSir Thomas Sean Connery, Scottish actor\nThe next task is to understand the implications of the shared insights, identify strategic courses of action and determine their specific challenges.\n\n## UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS\n\nLet us assume that one of the insights you drew from your situation analysis is that the unit profit of one of your products has risen over the past five years although its market share has gradually declined. If you want to understand the implications correctly, you need to understand the concept of cause-and-effect relationships.\n\nFor example, competition theory infers a positive relationship between profitability and market share. And indeed, empirical evidence shows that companies with a larger market share are more profitable on average than companies with smaller market shares. Therefore, is the size of market share causal to higher profitability, or are both variables co-determined by other factors? For example, unit profit can rise if you are able to lower unit costs. Market share can decline because new competitors have entered the market (viz. Apple and Samsung's loss of market share because of the expansion of Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi) or because market segments have changed relative to each other because of changes in customer preferences (size of mass market against size of the premium segment). Just consider the fast-growing \"affordable luxury\" segment for fashion accessories with suppliers like Michael Kors or Coach.\n\nWhen you discuss the implications, you should proceed just as unsparingly as you did in the situation analysis. Truth and clarity must have top priority because the implications will determine the fate of your company. You should rank the implications according to how they affect the rules of success for your company or your sector, and which risks and opportunities arise from the implications for your company.\n\n---\n\n\n# IDENTIFY OPTIONS \n\nStarting with the risks and opportunities profile derived from the implications, you can now examine the various strategic courses of action. To do this, you should categorize your insights in our extended product-market matrix (Ansoff, 1957; Kotler et al., 2012). It contains two additional dimensions. \"Consolidation\" comprises options for stagnating markets and crises. \"Growth\" looks at options for future markets and/or offerings in the blue-ocean strategy logic (Kim \\& Mauborgne, 2015). This will give you a broad spectrum of options to work with.\n\nAt this point, it is only about an initial categorization of the insights, not about making decisions. The modified product-market matrix contains 15 strategic courses of action on the topics of:\n\n- Growth or consolidation\n- Organic or inorganic growth (e.g., acquisitions)\n- Geographic concentration or expansion\n- Developing new but already existing markets or customer segments\n- Offering new products or services in familiar markets\n- Identifying future markets or customer segments\n\n---\n\n\n# STRATEGIC COURSES OF ACTION \n\n|  | REDUCE OFFERING | EXISTING OFFERING | MODIFIED OFFERING | NEW OFFERING | FUTURE OFFERING |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| MARKET <br> REDUCTION | 1. <br> Retreat: <br> Reduction of offerings and market presence | 2. <br> Product-constant market consolidation: Offer existing offerings in fewer markets |  |  |  |\n| EXISTING <br> MARKETS | 3. <br> Market- <br> constant product consolidation: Reduction of offering portfolio in existing markets | 4. <br> Market penetration: Gain additional market share with marketing activities | 5. <br> Product modification: An existing product is modified, the resulting value added induces the existing target group to make a repeat purchase | 6. <br> Product development: Developing a product further can induce established customers to make new purchases | 12. <br> Offering identification: Identification of future offerings for existing and familiar markets |\n| FAMILIAR <br> MARKETS |  | 7. <br> Market expansion: Existing products are sold to the familiar target group in new geographic markets | 8. <br> Limited diversification: Existing products are adapted to new geographic markets and modified for them | 9.1. <br> Partial diversification I: New products are developed for different requirements of new geographic markets |  |\n| NEW CUSTOMER <br> SEGMENTS |  | 10. <br> Market development: Development of new, e. g., regional markets to increase revenue from existing products | 9.2. <br> Partial diversification II: Products are modified according to new requirements of new customer segments | 11. <br> Diversification: horizontal, vertical, lateral | Future offerings for future markets/target groups |\n| FUTURE MARKETS/ CUSTOMER SEGMENTS |  | 13. <br> Market identification: Identification of future markets for existing and modified offerings |  | 14. <br> Future diversification: <br> New future offerings for future markets/target groups |  |\n\n---\n\n\n# CONSOLIDATION STRATEGIES \n\n## 1.
