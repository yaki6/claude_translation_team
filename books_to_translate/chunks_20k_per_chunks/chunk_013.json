  "source_text": "The \"strategic contour\" of your relevant market will visualize which offering features the competition is concentrating on and which benefits their offerings provide. You can then compare your offerings, identify market-specific differentiating features, and draw up the differentiating feature catalog for your strategic positioning. The value curve refers to a selected competitor or a strategic group of competitors within your sector. If several curves are portrayed for different companies in a schematic representation, what is known as the \"strategic contour\" emerges. The horizontal axis depicts the decisive offering features along the most important customer requirements. You have already determined these for your customers in the situation analysis. The vertical axis describes the performance level in your market and is portrayed in simplified form on a scale of low to high.\n\nYou can rank your company on the value curve. If your company gets a high figure for one factor, this means that it has a better performance compared to the competition (and the opposite). You can refer to the results from the \"Customers\" and \"Competition\" models for this. When you are making the assessment, the appraisals of your market experts from marketing and sales are relevant too, of course. Just like you did for your own company, you should rank the competitors or competitor groups you identified in the situation analysis. Look at the following example from the wine sector.\n\n---\n\n\n# STORIES FROM THE FIELD \n\nThe days when good wine was sold exclusively in darkened glass bottles with a cork seal appear to be long gone outside Germany. Countless packaging alternatives have meantime captured the wine markets right around the world and offer the right solution for every need.\n\nThe global market for wine cans is estimated to reach US\\$ 16,088 billion by 2028. In the forecasting period, this market is set to grow by an average of 7.2 percent per year (Data Bridge, 2021). The rising demand for conveniently consumable drinks and individual portions is the main driver of the market growth. It is being propelled by consumers' preference for ready-to-eat and ready-to-drink products because of a busy lifestyle and hectic working hours. Wine in cans is a trend that developed in the USA and spread to Europe. US movie director Francis Ford Coppola was the first to market wine in cans in 2004 and in doing so established an attractive new segment in the wine market. One of the authors of this book, Christian Underwood, launched the brand HOLY GRAPE as the first wine can brand in the German wine market in 2017 with a few wine enthusiast friends. The small portions of generally a maximum of 250 milliliters, with the easy-to-open pull tab that makes all bottle openers superfluous are particularly suitable for people on the move. The can protects the wine from light and oxygen - important factors for its shelf life. Traditional wine connoisseurs have reservations about the can. And that is precisely what appeals to the young target group of 25 to 35 -year-old women: hip, young, cool, and casual - always prepared for the next party. One thing is clear: the can is practical. It fits into every woman's purse, can't break, is lighter than glass and easy to portion out. In addition, it is 100 percent recyclable. None of these are classic offering features in the wine sector, as the authors of the blue ocean strategy already demonstrate.\n\n---\n\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\n# STRATEGIC CONTOUR OF THE WINE SECTOR AND CANNED WINE\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- **High**: Use of a specialized enological terminology and differentiation in pricing the wine.\n- **Perceived Value**: Marketing with normal advertising measures.\n- **Low**: Aging capability.\n\n## Value Features of the Wine Sector\n\n---\n\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nCREATED NEW VALUE FEATURES FOR NEW CUSTOMER SEGMENT\n\nAfter you have portrayed the current situation, you should now assess the individual offering features along the four dimensions \"Create, Enhance, Reduce, and Eliminate\". This will enable you to create a new value curve with a \"differentiating customer benefit\" and lower costs to find profitable demand even in a stiffly contested market with very similar products and achieve \"superior profits\".\n\n---\n\n\n# CUSTOMER BENEFIT \\& SUPERIOR PROFITS \n\nAs part of Strategy Workshop I, you should first generate value curves for your company and selected competitors. Then try to redesign your value curve in light of your target vision.\n\n## KEY QUESTIONS:\n\n1. What will we do differently or better than our competitors to generate a greater benefit for our target customers and higher profits for our company?\n2. What investments must we make to realize the \"differentiating customer benefit\"?\n3. How high are the expected profits?\n4. What risks will we run in doing so?\n5. Which business model should we introduce, i. e., how will we produce our offerings and bring them to market?\n6. Which offering features can we create that did not exist before?\n7. Which offering features must we enhance far above the market or sector standard?\n8. How will this business model help us reduce costs and/or increase revenues?\n9. Which offering features can we reduce far below the market or sector standard?\n10. Which offering features can we eliminate that were considered standard up to now?\n\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n## 1. Determine value offerings:\n\nDetermine which of your offerings you want to assess in comparison to the competition using a value curve. The products or services should be comparable, meaning that they solve the same problem for an identical customer group. Where there are very heterogeneous customer groups, different strategic contours per customer segment can help.\n\n## 2. Define offering features:\n\nWrite down 5 to 10 highly relevant features of your offerings. Be mindful of the customer requirements you determined and their importance today and in the future.\n\n## 3. Draw up a current value curve:\n\nConsider each individual offering feature and evaluate its level of benefit as perceived by customers. Draw up the value curves for your major competitors or competitor groups.\n\n## 4. Develop a desired value curve:\n\nNow define the new value curve for your company's offering with the help of the key questions in the matrix. List the specific features there.\n\n---\n\n\n# VALUE CURVE\n\nadapted from Kim und Mauborgne (2015)\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\n# FOUR-ACTIONS FRAMEWORK\n\n|  ELIMINATE | RAISE  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |   |\n|  REDUCE | CREATE  |\n\n---\n\n\n# GUSTOMER BENEFIT & SUPERIOR PROFITS\n\n---\n\n\n# FORMULATE CUSTOMER BENEFIT \\& SUPERIOR PROFITS \n\n## INSTRUCTIONS\n\nFormulating a pithy \"winning proposition\" has posed a major challenge to many executives in the past.\n\n1. That is why we recommend that you initially list the changes to the offering features descriptively.\n2. Then, in a second step, combine these into a single sentence:\n\"We ... (will make differently or better than the competition) ... in order to generate ... (benefit XYZ) for our (customers) and thus ... (be able to achieve better prices/reduce costs).\"\n\n## TIP\n\nDo not stick slavishly to the gap statement to work out the \"differentiating customer benefit.\" All you have to do is formulate the benefit in an initial catchy sentence. It is not necessary to put the sentence about your \"superior profits\" into a formulation that will be accessible to externals. What is important is that all those involved internally know, understand, and support the logic.\n\n## EXAMPLES\n\n- Southwest Airlines:\n\nOperate at lowest industry costs and provide fun-filled air travel which competes with the cost of car travel.\n\n- BILSTER BERG: DRIVING BUSINESS\n\nWe are the preferred partner of the automotive industry for individual automotive fascination. On one of the most demanding racetracks in Europe, with an offroad and dynamic course, we realize individual driving and brand experiences - in a natural setting. That is how we drive our customers' business forward.\n\n- SSI SCHÃ„FER Gruppe:\n\nWe enable intelligent processes to give our customers better business results. To do this, we offer modular and scalable intralogistics solutions and outstanding project execution. Our innovations and fu-ture-proof technologies drive the automation and sustainability of our customers worldwide.\n\n---\n\n\n# TARGET MARKETS, CUSTOMER SEGMENTS \\& OFFERINGS \n\n## SELECT THE RIGHT PLAYING FIELD\n\n\"Once you get on the playing field it's not about whether you're liked or not liked. All that matters is to play at a high level and do whatever it takes to help your team win.\"\nLeBron James, NBA basketball player\nSelecting the playing field that matches your company, gaining the best possible fans and offering them an enthralling experience is the core of every corporate strategy. You determine the competitive focus together with your team: In which \"target markets\" do you want to serve which \"customer segments\" with which \"offering\"? That might sound trivial initially. However, from countless discussions about market entry and market exits, lack of focus in customer segments or an overlarge offering portfolio with a thousand items when hardly anyone knows which of them is really bringing in money, our experience shows that it is by no means trivial to find the right competitive focus.\n\nThe decisions you make on Day 3 of Strategy Workshop I will have an immense impact on your entire company. Making decisions is not enough. They also must be accepted and implemented. And that too is anything but trivial. But you can make provisions!\n\n## DECIDE AND ACT STRATEGICALLY\n\nDuring the situation analysis, you viewed and sorted your potential strategic courses of action in the \"Challenges\" module and made initial assessments. Grow or consolidate? Geographic concentration or preferably expansion? Exploit new markets or customer segments? Change your range of products or services? You should have already said goodbye to options with high risk and low growth potential. Now you have an overview of the remaining options in front of you. But how do you now get to the decisions that will largely determine the direction your company should take, and the activities needed to do that? You can now come back to the \"differentiating customer benefit\". Determine the benefit features for your customers that you want to eliminate, reduce, improve, or create from scratch and transpose your new value offering into your portfolio, customer segment or target market structure.\n\nAcross the vertical axis of the product-market matrix, you decide which markets should be exited, retained, expanded (geographically, new customer segments)\n\n---\n\n\nor approached for the first time because of your \"strategic contour\" to implement your \"winning proposition\" and make the \"differentiating customer benefit\" tangible.\n\n# RULES FOR WINNERS \n\nIt goes without saying that the decisions about which game you want to play tomorrow on which playing field must be thought through very well, because, after all, you want to win. In their book, Playing to win, Lafley and Martini (2013) neatly sum up the rules for winners. We have condensed their insights into \"golden rules\" for you:\n\n1. Decide explicitly where you want to play and where you don't! Prioritize your decisions.\n2. Before you rate a market as structurally unattractive, have a good look to check whether there aren't attractive market pockets for you after all.\n3. Pursue no strategy without specific priorities. You can't play all markets and segments - so don't even try.\n4. Keep an eye out for possibilities to attack from an unexpected direction.\n5. Don't start a war on several fronts. Anticipate the reactions and actions of your competitors so that you have enough strength to still see your decisions through.\n6. Check the temptations of potential blue oceans in which seemingly no one is operating yet as to whether you just haven't discovered the \"first mover\" yet.\n\n---\n\n\n# TARGET MARKETS, CUSTOMER SEGMENTS \\& OFFERING \n\nOnly you and your team can change your company's game. When you are discussing strategic courses of action with your team, you are discussing the future of your company. Earlier decisions and consequences are in the past, you should treat them as such. If, for example, your current infrastructure is not the right one for the future you envisage, then the investments you made for it are irrelevant. These costs are \"sunk\" (scuppered), so to speak. They are costs of the past. If you cling on to the past, others will make a plaything of you.\n\n## KEY QUESTIONS:\n\n1. Which markets do we want to play in, and which don't we?\n2. Which market segments and geographic areas will we serve in the target markets?\n3. Which customer segments will we serve within these markets and geographic areas, and which won't we serve?\n4. How can customers be segmented usefully?\n5. Which products and services will we offer our focus customers, and which won't we offer?\n\n## INSTRUCTIONS\n\nWe recommend that you conduct the following three steps jointly with the entire group of workshop participants.\n\n1. Derive impacts: Use the table with the changed benefit features from the previous model and discuss the impacts on your current offering, on customer segments and markets.\n2. Assess potential: In the second step, assess with your team the revenue growth and/or cost savings potential on a scale of 0 to 3 .\n$0=$ no potential\n$1=$ below-average potential\n$2=$ average potential\n$3=$ above-average potential\n3. Assess the risk: Assess the risk according to the potential level of loss as well as the probability that the loss will occur.\nLevel of loss = very low, low, moderate, high, very high\nHigh Probability = impossible, unlikely, possible, likely, very likely\n4. Select course of action: Mark the courses of action in the productmarket matrix for which the potential is at least \" 2 \", the level of loss is not assessed to be \"high\" or \"very high\" and at the same time the probability of occurrence is not \"likely\" or \"very likely\".\n5. Discuss and select options: Discuss the remaining options once again individually and in detail.\n6. Make decisions: After the discussion, make clear decisions and don't put them off. Vote on the options. When you vote, each vote in the room counts for the same, and the participants have one vote each for every course of action for one of the following activities:\n\n- Watch (W)\n- Examine (E)\n- Do (D)\n\n7. Formulate target markets, customer segments, offerings: Your decisions, particularly in the \"do\" column, have an impact on your playing fields. For that reason, be sure to write them down directly onto the module card for all to see.\n\nMake a list of your target markets with the respective customer segments and the relevant offering portfolio. This is about the fundamental structure that you want to enter the playing field with. This structure should be easily comprehensible to everyone, both internal and external. To help you do this, you should imagine how you want to depict the three categories on your website to appeal to customers and demonstrate what you offer which customers in which market.\n\n---\n\n\n# DERIVATION (STEPS 1 TO 3)\n\n|  CHANGED BENEFIT FEATURE | EFFECT ON OFFERING | CUSTOMER\nSEGMENT | MARKET | POTENTIAL | LEVEL OF LOSS\n(Risk) | PROBABILITY\n(Risk)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n\n\n---\n\n\n# TARGET MARKETS\n\n---\n\n\n# COURSE OF ACTION (STEPS 4 AND 5) \n\n|  | REDUCE OFFERING | EXISTING OFFERING | MODIFIED OFFERING | NEW OFFERING | FUTURE OFFERING |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| MARKET REDUCTION | 1. <br> Retreat: <br> Reduction of offerings and market presence | 2. <br> Product-constant market consolidation: Offer existing offerings in fewer markets |  |  |  |\n| EXISTING MARKETS | 3. <br> Market- <br> constant product consolidation: <br> Reduction of offering portfolio in existing markets | 4. <br> Market penetration: Gain additional market share with marketing activities | 5. <br> Product modification: An existing product is modified, the resulting value added induces the existing target group to make a repeat purchase | 6. <br> Product development: Developing a product further can induce established customers to make new purchases | 12. <br> Offering identification: Identification of future offerings for existing and familiar markets |\n| FAMILIAR MARKETS |  | 7. <br> Market expansion: Existing products are sold to the familiar target group in new geographic markets | 8. <br> Limited diversification: Existing products are adapted to new geographic markets and modified for them | 9.1. <br> Partial diversification I: New products are developed for different requirements of new geographic markets |  |\n| NEW CUSTOMER SEGMENTS |  | 10. <br> Market development: Development of new, e. g., regional markets to increase revenue from existing products | 9.2. <br> Partial diversification II: Products are modified according to new requirements of new customer segments | 11. <br> Diversification: horizontal, vertical, lateral | Future offerings for future markets/target groups |\n| FUTURE MARKETS/ CUSTOMER SEGMENTS |  | 13. <br> Market identification: Identification of future markets for existing and modified offerings |  | 14. <br> Future diversification: <br> New future offerings for future markets/target groups |  |\n\n## NOTE\n\nIf one of your decisions falls on course of action number 12, 13 or 14, the \"Experiment\" process step might possibly help you process this potential \"blue ocean\".
