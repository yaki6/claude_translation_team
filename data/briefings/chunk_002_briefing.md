## Special Notes

### Critical Framework
The five fundamental questions (#1-#5) are essential - they structure the entire book's approach. Ensure each question is clearly translated and the numbering is preserved.

### Academic Citations
Maintain all academic references (Porter, Schumpeter, Keynes, Kahnemann) with proper Chinese transliteration of names and preservation of years.

### Industry Example
The Intel/AMD/TSCM case is highly relevant to Chinese readers given China's semiconductor industry focus. Ensure technical accuracy while making it accessible.

### Behavioral Economics
The bounded rationality and cognitive bias discussion is sophisticated - use established Chinese psychological terminology while maintaining accessibility.

### Process Philosophy
"Trust the Process" philosophy should resonate with Chinese emphasis on systematic approaches (系统化方法). Consider adding Chinese business examples of process-driven success.
