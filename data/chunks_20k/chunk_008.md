Kim und Mauborgne (2004) proposed a further option with their "blue ocean" strategy. The idea is to change the strategic competitive environment and make competition irrelevant through value innovation. Customers' key value criteria when buying a product (price, convenience, design, etc.) are determined by market analyses and their fulfilment evaluated and visualized (value curve) for existing competing offerings. To create a "blue ocean" product, it must then be examined which benefits can be reduced or eliminated in comparison to the existing offerings and which should be developed or newly added.

| RED OCEAN STRATEGY | BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY |
| :-- | :-- |
| Competition in existing market | Creation of new markets |
| Beat the competition | Avoid the competition |
| Use existing demand | Develop new demand |
| Direct connection between value, <br> price and costs | Eliminate the direct connection <br> between value, price and costs |
| Orient the entire system of corporate activity <br> towards strategic decisions on differentiation <br> or low costs | Orient the entire system of corporate activity <br> towards differentiation and low costs |

The concept of value innovation calls Porter's classic competitive strategies into question, according to which successful companies outside of niche markets are either cost leaders or quality leaders. Using a blue ocean strategy, you leave the bloody "red ocean", the saturated market with stiff "value-for-money" competition, overfilled with fellow competitors all offering interchangeable products.

Before you choose this path, you should first check whether your company really is swimming in the red ocean and needs a blue ocean strategy for its survival. Because these oases of bliss are not easy to find, the road there is often onerous and at the end of the road, the oasis could turn out to be a mirage.

# COMPETITION 

Get an overview of the situation: Who are your competitors, how profitable are they compared to you, how do you stand among the competition, today, what structures do your markets have, how do market participants behave, and what market results can be expected?

The competitive environment and its consequences can be investigated with a simple analytical framework. According to the "structure-conduct-performance" model, company and market results (profits, prices) follow on from the behavior of market participants on imperfect markets. Market behavior is expressed in the type and intensity of competition and is mirrored in the strategies and tactics of market participants. Market behavior is predominantly determined by market structure. It reflects the number and size of market participants, the degree of differentiation among offerings as well as the presence of market barriers. Feedback effects occur here, meaning that market results affect market behavior and market structure (for example, Bayer's takeover of Monsanto - results-based behavior - directly reduced the number of actual competitors).

## KEY QUESTIONS:

1. Who are our direct competitors at the moment?
2. How do they serve the market? How effective are they from a customer perspective compared to us?
3. How is our profitability compared to our major competitors? What are the key factors for profit development?
4. Who are our indirect competitors, and what unique benefits do they offer? Who are potential competitors? Who poses the greatest danger, and why?

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Analyze your markets using the Structure-Conduct-Performance model.
2. List your current competitors in each market (segment) by name.
3. Classify the competitors in the competition matrix according to the strategy they pursue.
4. Compare your own profitability with that of your top 3, 5 or 10 competitors.

## TIP

Competitors you can compare 1:1 with yourself are not always easy to find. Differences in activity-portfolios and in company organization affect profitability. Nonetheless, you should still attempt to form a peer group and compare yourself to the companies in that group. That is what investors do too when they benchmark a sector or a target company. If you can select your peer group, do it - otherwise, others will do it for you.

## CAUTION

The task does not merely comprise getting an in-depth overview of your actual and potential competitors and their behavior. It is also important to understand how they create value added for customers and how they make money. Think about your challenge: to offer customers greater value added than your competitors. And although your direct rivals are important: Do not forget indirect competitors and future new challengers.

# TRENDS 

## KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE FUTURE

"It is not our task to predict the future, but to be well prepared for it."
Pericles, a leading statesman of ancient Athens
Use your power of imagination - a gift that nature equipped us with - and imagine a tiger. Do you need some help with this? Tigers have colorful stripes for camouflage. They can grow to up to 4 meters long. They can weigh up to 685 pounds. Tigers have the biggest canine teeth of all cats (often around 2.5 inches). They have been on Earth for around 2 million years.

How were we able to survive in our habitat in the face of a menace like this? How was this possible? Think about it and look at yourself.

That's right, a certain ability was required: the ability to recognize problems and solve them creatively.

Let's go on a journey into the history of humanity. Our first ancestors emerged around 2.5 million years ago in Africa. At some point, they began using sticks as weapons and tools. The hand axe is the oldest known tool and dates back 1.75 million years. From about 40,000 years BCE, homo sapiens gradually displaced other hominid species. The "wise human" had developed superior abilities and thus advantages in the evolutionary competition. As artifacts and cave drawings show, there was a veritable explosion in creativity with the development of clothing, tools, and weapons, as well as the creation of art.

This example shows: Creativity is in everyone's nature. Using creativity to generate innovations increasingly faster is becoming the decisive factor for success in the 21st century. Innovation waves are becoming increasingly shorter. Today, product life cycles in the technological field are about 6 to 12 months in many cases. You have no time to wait anymore for the muse or your development department to whisper in your ear.

You have to actively and systematically work on innovations so that you can constantly make new value offerings and survive in the competition between companies.

In his theory of economic development (1911), Schumpeter demonstrated that a company can temporarily become a monopolist through innovation - until imitators enter the market or the innovation loses its importance because of other developments. Skimming off the temporary monopolistic profits is the economic incentive to innovate. At the same time, it is the invitation to imitators to try and get a slice of the pie for themselves. Schumpeter's competition as an interplay of innovation and imitation leads to the creative destruction of the status quo, or as we say today: to disruption.

Design thinking as a creative method takes the human perspective as a starting point for developing innovative products, services, or experiences which are not just attractive but also realizable and marketable.

This is certainly an excellent course of action, but how can you shorten this path and identify the trends that affect your company and your business model? Or which trend currents promise innovation opportunities and future potential?

We recommend trend scouting. That means: Get out of your own knowledge silo. View the developments in research, technology, or social culture as well as problem solutions found by other companies (especially start-ups) from a cross-sectoral perspective. This will give you inspiration and targeted stimulus for specific future-oriented fields. Use the leading innovation databases to gain a broad overview of innovations.

Build your own "trend radar" with your team to act as an orientation and a de-cision-making instrument. It will provide an intuitively comprehensible portrayal of the trends that are relevant to you and is the starting point for your strategic innovation work. You will evaluate the trends you identify regarding their relevance for your company, arrange them in the order of their individual degree of maturity on your radar and decide on one of the following action recommendations: act, prepare, observe. When you have a trend radar, you will become sensitized to innovation opportunities at an early stage and can reorient your company strategically on time.

Claudia Knacke (2022) drew the same conclusion in the white paper published by trend and innovation consultancy TRENDONE, based on a survey of 85 innovation managers: "Systematic trend management imparts a better sense of orientation to a company - a key competency that enables sustainable growth."

# TRENDS 

You will find key questions to conduct your own trend analysis here. It is an exploratory process. New questions can emerge from your queries and challenges. Look the truth in the eye to find the proverbial crux of the problem.

## KEY QUESTIONS:

1. Which macrotrends are the most important for the structure of our sector or industry? What are their causes and consequences?
2. How are these trends changing the rules of business and the critical success factors?
3. What threats do these trends constitute for our profitability and our business model? What opportunities do they open up?

## COLLECT DATA

Start trend scouting by identifying the macrotrends that are relevant to your sector or industry by looking at the major megatrends (for example, climate change). Many of the professional providers of trend analyses initially identify microtrends as inspiration, then cluster these into macrotrends and combine them into megatrends to organize and structure the trend topics. If you don't need completely independent scouting for your specific requirements but just wish to work with general sector assessments, you can utilize the macrotrends that have already been identified in innovation databases.

## ANALYZE

Collect the macrotrends in the designated table.
Evaluate them according to:

## 1. Effect:

How strong do you estimate the effect of the trend on your company? Scale: $1=$ very high to $6=$ very low
You will use the "effect" criterion to evaluate the strength of the effect that the trend will likely have. Note that trends can affect individual or several levels of a company.

## 2. Time of mainstream adoption

When is the trend anticipated within your sector by most market participants?
Scale: $\quad 1=0-2$ years
to $6=10+$ years up
You are looking for the time when the "early majority" will adopt the trend.

## 3. Competence:

How well is your company prepared for the trend?
Scale: $1=$ very well to $6=$ very little
You will use the "competence" criterion to evaluate how mature your company's reaction to this trend is already today in terms of structures, strategies, projects, or prototypes.

## CATEGORIZE

Total up the scores for each section. Depending on the overall points you achieve, the trends can now be categorized into three different stages of action in each circle. Using the innovation categories, you can select the appropriate category field where the innovation in question is occurring.

## Watch: 13 to 18 points

The trend is well known. Its influence and speed of adoption among the mainstream is currently still assessed as low. However, the trend should be systematically observed to see how it develops going forward and periodically reassessed.

Think: 7 to 12 points
This trend will have a high to very high impact in the foreseeable future. The trend's subordinate features and the paths of influence should now be understood in detail to prepare specific measures.

## Act: 3 to 6 points

These trends have a high to very high impact.

# BRAVE NEW WORLD 

"Who will have the greatest effect on digitalization - the CEO, the CTO, the CIO, or Covid-19?"
Social media joke
Whether Covid 19, financial crisis, inflation, supply chain problems, the Ukrai-ne-Russia war, or a shortage of almost all key resources like personnel, raw materials, etc. - one thing is abundantly clear: nothing is as clear anymore as it had previously appeared to be. For many people, that is confirmation that we are living in a VUCA world. The acronym was coined by the United States War College in the era after the Cold War and characterizes our time as increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous.

But how are you, your team and your company dealing with constantly changing scenarios? What effects can be expected, and what are you prepared for, and how?

## A WORLD WE DON'T UNDERSTAND

A journey to Delphi, the writings or Nostradamus, or looking into a crystal ball is hardly likely to provide you with the best possible assessment of the future. In his book Antifragile (2012), Nicholas Taleb develops an evolutionary theory of hazard in which he divides the universe into two types of system: (1) fragile, unstable, and prone to disruption, which will disappear very soon, as well as (2) "variability-loving" systems with a type of hyper-robustness which he named "antifragility". His motto: "Embrace hazard! Affirm chaos!" They are not just disruptions but in fact the true drivers of change. And that is why it is not about trying to predict or understand the future. On the contrary: Even attempting to do so is the road to perdition. It is about the sensitivity, the susceptibility to disruption - and the dilemma that major, unexpected occurrences cause unsolvable problems.

Concentrate on the major influencing factors in the broader environment and derive the scenarios relevant to you. This is how you can focus your strategy and prepare your company for the unforeseeable. The aim is to understand universal trends that go beyond the factors specific to your sector. What is happening around you in the political, economic, sociocultural, ecological, or legal sphere, and how is it impacting on your sector or directly on your business or company?

# MAKE YOUR COMPANY CRISIS-PROOF 

Identify the major influencing factors in your broader environment. Concentrate primarily on assessing the impact of changes in these factors and not on how likely these changes are. Which changes would be hazardous for your company? Which changes would make your company stronger? Derive the level of resilience of your company in the event that these changes occur. Is your company's resistance fragile, robust, resilient, or antifragile?

The aim is to conduct an educated risk-return assessment. Which changes entail low earnings potential but high risks of losses (not just financial)? Conversely, which entail high earnings potential combined with low risks or losses? You should be very well prepared for the first risk-return scenario or eliminate it by taking appropriate measures. According to Taleb, everything that is fragile will break anyway. To ensure your company's well-being, you do not have to be able to predict the future. Instead, you must remove those things from your future which are fragile and susceptible to disruption. You must therefore make decisions which concentrate on the consequences that you know instead of on probabilities that you cannot know.

# BROADER ENVIRONMENT 

If you want to attain the best possible overview of the developments in your broader environment, it helps to identify the key factors using a slight modification of a classic in strategic analysis. The P.E.S.(T.)E.L. method is an acronym that stands for political, economic, socio-cultural (technological - excluded here because it is in the Trend module already), environmental, and legal. You should evaluate this overview by reviewing the consequences for your company and its resistance. It allows you to make concrete strategic decisions without having to think in scenarios, probabilities, or eventualities.

## KEY QUESTIONS:

1. How are developments in various areas of our strategic environment (politics, macro economy, social culture, ecology, and law) affecting us?
2. How resistant is our company and business model to the anticipated consequences?
