- Accessible external and internal "studies"
- "Exploratory interviews" with selected customers and non-customers
- Creation of "personas" combined with external methods for validating hypotheses
Other:
- Use "customer shadowing" to observe customers using the products and services
- Illustrate the customer journey with "customer journey maps"
- Directed discussion by "focus group interviews"
- Investigate customer satisfaction using the "net promoter score" (NPS)
- Use "conjoint analysis" to identify customer preferences


## TIP

To identify your customers' requirements better, observe three potential requirement dimensions for your customers and describe these briefly in your own words:

1. Tasks: Which tasks does the customer want to complete in their work or in their daily life?
2. Problems: Which risks, bad results or obstacles arise when the customer completes the task?
3. Benefit: Which specific value added would the customer like to achieve by completing this task?

## ANALYZE THE DATA

Based on the results of your survey, draw up a list of your customers' requirements by customer segment. Restrict the requirements to the top 10 and prioritize them. Categorize the requirements by type of requirement (task, problem, benefit). Finally, make an estimate for how well your company and the competitors fulfil the requirements today: $+=$ requirement fulfilled
$0=$ requirement partially fulfilled

- = requirement not fulfilled


## CAUTION

Observing customers is not a desk job. Leave the office and meet your customers in their habitat. For your customer analyses draw on the knowledge, experiences and insights of your employees from various functional areas, such as Marketing, Sales or Customer Service. You can evaluate the results in the first Strategy Workshop.

# FORMULATE INSIGHTS 

## INSTRUCTIONS

Draw your key insights from analyzing customer requirements. Formulate them in short and snappy understandable language as preparation for the first strategy workshop. You should regard the formulation as a coherent story which you will tell later as the basis of your strategic decisions. You can then draft the ultimate formulations with your team in the workshop.

## EXAMPLES

- Customers increasingly expect more individualization in products.
- The days of a "one-stop shop" with a full product range are gone.
- Rising customer expectations regarding sustainability are clashing with increasing price pressure on the part of OEMs.
- B2B customers are expanding their value chains by handling our core business themselves.

# MARKET 

## IDENTIFY RELEVANT MARKETS

"The grass is always greener in the neighbor's garden, but the weeds grow better in our own."

Hans-Jürgen Quadbeck-Seeger, German chemist

How well do you know the playing field your company is playing on? How will it develop in the future? Does it still offer your company sufficient growth potential, or are there potentially more attractive opportunities for your company on other playing fields?

Even if you or your colleagues on your management team believe we know the company's playing field like the back of your hand, you should take a step back and cast a fresh, impartial look at the arena of markets and market segments. To ensure you avoid errors of assessment because of cognitive distortions (such as confirmation bias which provokes one-sided data selection) we recommend that you additionally request a neutral party to provide an independent observation.

What you need for the strategic evaluation of your arena is on the one hand an overall picture of the markets and market segments your company addresses already, and on the other hand you should understand the development to date and the potential for the future of every current playing field and potential new fields of activity.

Your task is to evaluate the current size of the market, market attractiveness, which must be measured by the opportunities for profit and are influenced by the type and intensity of the competition. You should answer the following questions:

1. How big is the market?
2. How is the market developing?
3. How big is the theoretical market potential?

## ON 1: DETERMINE MARKET SIZE

Before we can determine the size of a market, the market as well as any submarkets and product segments must be defined. The sector boundary can be used as a starting point. The sector describes companies that offer similar products and services, like for example, trading, construction, or the health sector.

---


Within every sector there are subgroups. For trading, for example, we find the subgroups of retail, wholesale, specialized trade, or food retail. Publicly accessible sources for sectoral data are available for example, from the Federal Statistics Office for Germany and Eurostat at the EU level. There are also several commercial data providers which can prepare data for you on the number of providers, revenues, unit sales or customer preferences. Of course, you can also have studies conducted on the volume and potential of relevant product-specific and geographic market segments.

Get yourself a detailed insight into your relevant market.

# ON \#2: CHECK THE MARKET DYNAMICS 

When you look at the market development up to today, your task is to gain a better understanding of the market dynamics. What is the condition of the relevant focus market on which you are operating? How have supply and demand developed? Is the market growing, is it saturated, or is it even shrinking? Are there signs of disruption by new market participants, new technologies or new business models, or all of these together?

The market for recorded music and the surrounding music business are a good and a well-known example of how technological innovations have led to immense changes: from shellac through vinyl, tape and cassette to CD and minidisc, right up to MP3 and streaming. With equally immense repercussions on the market participants along the entire value chain: music labels, press plants, manufacturers of playback devices, record shops, and of course, the artists.

Are you now being overcome by a strong impulse to say this?: "But we know what is going down in our markets, we're in there every day!" Don't let yourself be fooled by your reflex to follow your gut instinct. Look at the figures, data, and facts with your management team. For your most important strategic decision of where, when, and how you want to deploy your limited resources, it makes a substantial difference whether you want to move in fast-growing markets with high demand or achieve higher market penetration in saturated markets with existing products. In the first case, you have to pay increased attention to adapting your production capacities and volumes at the right time in reaction to rising demand. In the second case, you have to assume rising distribution and marketing costs.

Even if extrapolating from the past to the present and into the future must be treated with caution, insights on market development up to now can provide viable indications for future market dynamics.

Just imagine that you want to sell on the German market jeans for adults that were manufactured abroad. How large is the market potential? Let us do a quick "back-of-the-envelope" calculation. The total population in Germany is around 83 million. Let us assume that your envisaged target group are "adults" in the 40 to 59 age group. That is approximately 24 million people (Statista (2022)) or 24 million potential buyers. If every person in this target group buys on average two pairs of jeans every year, that translates into potentially around 48 million pairs of jeans for this age group. In 2021, 110 million pairs of jeans were sold in Germany across all age groups. With approximately a 28 percent share of the total population, this means that about 31 million pairs of jeans were sold in your target segment. So, the purchasing frequency therefore averaged about 1.5 pairs of jeans per year. Let us make a conservative assumption for this age group with its high purchasing power and take an average sales price of $€ 100$ for each pair of jeans, this comes to a segment turnover of $€ 3.1$ billion. That is a ballpark figure.

For calculating market potential, there is a simple formula:

# MARKET POTENTIAL = TARGET GROUP SIZE $\times$ PURCHASE FREQUENCY $\times$ VOLUME PER BUYER $\times$ PRICE 

One challenge in this calculation is estimating the influencing factors that could strongly affect market potential, for example, product life cycle.

How far back should your retrospective go? As a general rule, five years are a good time frame for recognizing changes and their causes.

# STORIES FROM THE FIELD 

The following story from a consultancy project illustrates how important it is to know the real market potential.

In the business unit of a globally operating med-tech company, there was a regional market in Eastern Europe that exceeded all the other markets in the business unit in all product segments. For this reason, it was included in the random sampling of markets to investigate market potential.

After we had recorded the number of relevant clinics in this Eastern European market using external data and superimposed these on the clinics mapped in the customer relationship management (CRM) system, we discovered that not even 50 percent of the existing clinics were recorded in the CRM system. Despite having a large sales team when compared to all the other markets, less than 50 percent of market potential was being addressed. That meant that the market was being worked far too little and the real market share was in fact far behind previous estimates. This result prompted the company's management to make an immense hike in the sales team in this market, and after farther reaching analysis, in other markets as well. Reinforcing the sales team thus led to a significant increase in sales.

# MARKET 

Which markets and market segment are most relevant for you? Get yourself an overview of the existing and possible potential. You will be surprised at what you discover about your own playing field when you dare to come out from behind your "organizational blindness", so to speak, and take the outside perspective. Maybe you will discover a profitable niche, understand the logic of market dynamics better, or, now that your organizational blindness has been "cured", recognize which opportunities are still available.

## KEY QUESTIONS:

1. Which markets are we active in today?
2. How are our relevant markets developing?
3. What market potential do our current markets offer?
4. What time and resources will we have to put in to leverage the existing market potential?
5. Where are attractive future markets already today or where are they emerging?

## COLLECT DATA

Potential sources for gathering data are, for example:

- Government Statistical Offices (for example, US Census Bureau, EU Eurostat, German Federal Statistical Office)
- Chambers of industry and commerce
- Industry associations
- Market studies (for example, by market research institutes or consultancy firms)
- Own market research

We recommend that you compile your own market analyses, irrespective of whether they are based on expert discussions or customer surveys, if no informative market data or studies are available.

## TIP

In an era of "big data", the creators of market analyses often lose themselves in the details, so devise a systematic approach before you start. Which data is important to make inferences about the relevant market? Where will we find this data? It is not a question of analyzing the entire market. Instead, the objective is to get reliable facts and figures to check the plausibility of your assumptions and perceptions of market activity.

## ANALYZE THE DATA

Look at every market and every market segment individually. Make a point of varying your analyses according to region. This will ensure you do not stay locked into any internal logic the business units might have. Proceed in three steps:

1. Examine the size of the market.
2. Assess how the market is developing.
3. Calculate your market potential.

## CAUTION

Don't be afraid of incomplete data! It is not always possible to find all relevant information. Approximate as best you can - it is better to have "fuzzy" data than none at all! You will get further by knowing that there will be inaccuracies in the knowledge than by not having a market analysis at all.

# HOLD YOUR OWN AGAINST THE COMPETITION 

"Competition is a process for separating the slackers from the industrious." Hermann Simon, German management consultant and entrepreneur, originator of the Hidden Champions idea
"Who are your competitors really?" The answers to this question could either amuse or shock you: From "We have no competitors!" to up to 10 different nominations from five interviewees from the management team, you will get everything. But your ignorance or arrogance will not stop your customers from buying from someone else.

What alternatives do customers have to your offerings? There are direct and indirect alternatives. British budget airline Ryanair is in direct competition with airlines like easyJet, which operate in the same segment and on the same routes. However, these providers also compete indirectly with offerings from rail and bus companies (like Flixbus in Germany), or customers' ability to go by car. In the wake of covid-19, airlines with relevant offerings for business travelers are now increasingly competing with new market participants, providers of SaaS video conferences like Zoom. Their offerings have made a large portion of business trips obsolete and have therefore substantially changed the rules of the game in the market for business trips.

Customer requirements are decisive in determining which game you can play. They delineate your playing field with its segments. The competitors are the opposition that wants to prevent you from scoring goals with your customers and ultimately tries to score more goals than you itself. What is the right positioning for your company to succeed and leave the field victorious?

## BEATING THE COMPETITION

Michael E. Porter (1980) examined and named the most recognized strategies for companies in competition. He identified three generic strategies.

1. Cost leadership
2. Differentiation strategy
3. Niche strategy (focus)

---

# COST LEADERSHIP 

Cost leadership means that your company has the lowest costs in comparison with competitors for creating and marketing a beneficial offering for their customers. With this cost advantage, you can even still emerge victorious in the end from a price war. While the competition slides into the red, you are still making profits. Cost leadership results from an organization that is optimized for efficiency by exploiting economies of scale, scope and experience. Economies of scale arise when your unit costs fall as your company size or volume of production increases. Economies of scope emerge when you can spread fixed costs across several products and thus achieve lower unit costs per product. Economies of learning, or experience curve economies, are evident in your productivity: With the same cost level, you can produce more than you previously did. Cost leadership does not automatically mean price leadership. It is your choice whether you utilize your cost advantages for a low-price policy or if you want to use the cost savings to invest in achieving a qualitative differentiation for your products. However, if you want to be a price leader, then cost leadership is the crucial prerequisite.

---


What you can do better or where you differ from your competitors can make a difference to your customers - if they perceive this difference positively. Appreciated differentiation creates a product area with a certain amount of scope for price setting and customer loyalty. Key methods of differentiation are (cf. Mintzberg et al., 1995):

- Price leadership
- Image/brand
- Service/Customer support
- Design
- Quality leadership
- Undifferentiated versus non-differentiated offerings

Anyone who wants to be a price leader in a low-price segment has to be a cost leader, otherwise a more reasonably priced competitor can always undercut them. If you aim for cost leadership, you need high production and sales volumes to exploit economies of scale, scope or productivity. For this reason, you have to address the mass market. Instead of using cost benefits for rock-bottom-price leadership, you can use them to increase other elements of customer benefit (for example, brand, after-sales service) and achieve a higher price. If you want to be the highest-price leader in the high-price segment, you have to be a quality leader. Producers of premium or luxury products must have mastered the entire spectrum of product attributes like design, function, branding and image.

# IN THE NICHE 

Niches can be very profitable, as Hermann Simon (2007) showed with the Hidden Champions among German SMEs. Anyone who concentrates on specific customer groups, products or geographic markets can create offerings that cover customer requirements in those niches more suitably and cost-effectively than the offerings of competitors focused on the overall market.

## TAKE DIFFERENT PATHS

Should you follow several strategies in parallel? No! According to Porter, this will not bring success, as the strategies contradict each other in their internal logic. How do you think you can become a cost leader if you are banking on innovations at the same time and have to fork over a lot of money for research and development? But to every rule, there is an exception! Hybrid competitive strategies attempt to combine cost leadership and differentiation (see

---


for example, Michael Dell's original business model), whether simultaneously, sequentially (see for example, Toyota with the introduction of the Lexus premium brand) or multi-locally. In emerging countries, international technology companies often offer their high-quality products in low(er)-tech versions which are also produced locally and thus more cost-effectively (see for example, General Electric's portable ECG for the Indian market). Hybrid strategies require a well-designed brand strategy.
