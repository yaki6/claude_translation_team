Idea: Gradual exit from unprofitable markets or market segments and discontinuation of offerings

## Implementation:

- Discontinuation of entire business operations
- Sale of segment offering and market presence to other companies or investors
- Sale of entire business areas

Benefit: You reduce complexity, save resources, and avoid losses. At the same time, you create room to maneuver for the remaining or for new fields of activity. Furthermore, the sale of business units can contribute to stocking up your "war chest" for acquisitions.

Risk: The risk is low, since you know exactly what you will be foregoing tomorrow. However, exiting business areas and markets can incur costs. In some cases, you can also lose the size necessary to be able to exploit cost-cutting economies of scale and economies of scope.

## 2. PRODUCT-CONSTANT MARKET CONSOLIDATION: EXISTING OFFERINGS + REDUCE MARKETS

Idea: Exit from markets, market segments or distribution channels that are not lucrative or not sufficiently well established. Existing offerings are consolidated.

## Implementation:

- Sale of regional business unit
- Discontinuation of market presence
- Exit from individual distribution channels
(e.g., stationary retail in favor of digital platform)
- Exit from certain customer segments
(e.g., luxury segment in favor of "affordable luxury")

Benefit: You free up resources to be able to concentrate on well developed markets with better potential.

---


Risk: You lose established market access and leave the field to the competition. If you enter the market again, you will incur entry costs. Then you may potentially have to overcome new market entry barriers and hold your ground against the established competition.

# 3. MARKET-CONSTANT PRODUCT CONSOLIDATION: REDUCE OFFERINGS + EXISTING MARKETS 

Idea: You do a targeted clear-out of loss-makers or resource-guzzlers in your offering portfolio.

## Implementation:

- Closure or disposal of entire business areas
- Reduction of product segments, product lines or special products in all or selected markets

Benefit: You free up resources for the further development of your core business or alternatively your profit drivers. The costs of your value chain can fall if, for example, you were unable to produce or procure specific product groups locally.

Risk: The risk is low. You can calculate exactly what the exit from the business field or the products will cost and how much revenue will be lost. One thing is probably certain: Your competitors will be pleased.

# GROWTH STRATEGIES 

## 4. MARKET PENETRATION: EXISTING OFFERINGS + EXISTING MARKETS

Idea: Try to serve existing markets more intensively with existing offerings.

## Implementation:

Greater market penetration by:

- Increasing marketing activities
- Reducing prices
- Acquiring a competitor in the existing market
- Customer loyalty and purchase incentive programs
- Improving sales team competence and/or increasing sales channels and sales resources

Benefit: You create greater demand in the existing market through higher sales to established customers and acquisition of new customers.

Risk: You are familiar with the market, which keeps the risk low, especially if you are in a growing market, whereas in saturated markets your growth potential is clearly discernible. Cost per sale rises significantly with each additional gain in market share. In addition, you have to poach customers from your competitors and your rivals will respond in kind to this.

## 5. PRODUCT MODIFICATION: MODIFIED OFFERINGS + EXISTING MARKETS

Idea: You modify your offerings somewhat. The resulting value added induces the existing target group to make a repeat purchase.

## Implementation:

- Modification of packaging, product features, material use, or amounts
- Offerings of special or limited editions

Benefit: You know your target group and offer them new purchase incentives with modifications that are easy to implement. You might also increase purchasing frequency this way.

Risk: The growth potential is in the established customers to whom you are giving new incentives to buy. At the same time, your risk is low because you can test the modifications in small batch numbers to see whether and how well they are accepted.

---


# 6. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: NEW OFFERINGS + EXISTING MARKETS 

Idea: You aim to satisfy established customer requirements in existing markets with new offerings.

## Implementation:

- Development of new products or product lines and service offerings
- Substitution of existing offerings with follow-on products
- Development of new brands

Benefit: You will be an innovation leader satisfying existing requirements with new products. This will give you a competitive edge because of unique products or cost benefits.

Risk: You could be left saddled with high development costs because customer acceptance and thus market success are unknowns.

## 7. MARKET EXPANSION: EXISTING OFFERINGS + FAMILIAR MARKETS

Idea: You sell existing products and services to the familiar target group in new geographic markets.

## Implementation:

- You enter new geographic markets with your existing offering portfolio.
- You can attempt to acquire an established supplier in the regional market to overcome market entry barriers faster.

Benefit: You use your existing competencies and gradually increase your sales potential by opening up additional potential in other geographic regions.

Risk: Customer requirements and preferences in a different geographic market could deviate tremendously from those in existing markets. You will encounter local competitors that satisfy customer requirements and preferences better than your existing product offerings. Localizing your market strategy will incur additional costs.

---


# 8. LIMITED DIVERSIFICATION: MODIFIED OFFERINGS + FAMILIAR MARKETS 

Idea: You modify your existing offerings to be able to sell these to your target customers in other geographic markets.

Implementation: Modify your offerings according to regional regulatory, linguistic, cultural, and technical requirements.

Benefit: You utilize existing competencies and resources to position your modified offerings in the target markets and thus increase your sales potential.

Risk: The modifications you make to fulfill the requirements of the target market are cost-intensive and time-consuming (e.g., getting approval for medical products in a new geographic markets) and customer acceptance is an unknown.

### 9.1. PARTIAL DIVERSIFICATION I: NEW OFFERINGS + FAMILIAR MARKETS

Idea: New products are developed and sold for familiar customer segments in other regional markets.

## Implementation:

- Development of innovative offerings that are tailored to specific regional customer requirements
- Development of new brands for an adapted regional targeting and definition of other markets
- Acquisition of a competitor with market access and product innovation in familiar customer segment
- High level of marketing activity
- Development or adaptation of sales structures and distribution channels for the new market

Benefit: You can address specifically attractive regional markets with high potential. In some cases, the regional product innovation can also be used for existing markets.

Risk: If the new offerings are only developed for a regional market, the costs of development and of building a new marketing and sales architecture may not be scalable due to limited demand potential.

---


# 9.2. PARTIAL DIVERSIFICATION: MODIFIED OFFERINGS + NEW CUSTOMER SEGMENTS 

Idea: Modification of existing offerings according to the requirements of new customer segments.

## Implementation:

- You will reach a younger target group with a slightly modified offering (e.g., insurance) through a new sales channel (e.g., e-commerce)
- Adjustment of marketing for the new customer segments
- Development of a special brand appropriate for the target group to address the new customer segment

Benefit: You transpose your modified products onto new customer segments with manageable time and expense and exploit new growth potential without significant market entry barriers.

Risk: A lack of reputation or customer awareness in the new market segment can cause problems. Or the modifications to your product may not sufficiently satisfy the requirements of the new customer segment because you are still lacking specific knowledge of the target group.

## 10. MARKET DEVELOPMENT: EXISTING OFFERINGS + NEW CUSTOMER SEGMENTS

Idea: Increase sales of your existing products by expanding into new markets, market segments or customer segments.

## Implementation:

- Invest into developing new market or customer segments
- Invest into tapping new geographic markets

Benefit: If your company has offerings that meet demand in different markets or customer segments, this strategy is the next logical growth step.

Risk: Compared with the market penetration or product development strategies, the market development strategy involves a higher risk. Foreign markets differ significantly in purchasing power and consumer habits. But new customer segments can also spring a few surprises.

---


# 11. DIVERSIFICATION: NEW OFFERINGS + NEW CUSTOMER SEGMENTS 

Idea: Tap new markets with new offerings.

- Horizontal development: You develop new products that are rooted in your company's core business area. You utilize available expertise along your existing value chain. That means there is a material connection between the existing offering and the new offering, even if the new offering solves customer requirements differently (example: a sausage manufacturer also offering vegetarian products).
- Vertical: You develop a new offering at an upstream or downstream stage of the value chain (example: an automobile manufacturer acquires a supplier and also offers their products, like for example, tires or accessory components). This enables you to reduce dependencies, secure market shares, and expand your own growth.
- Lateral/diagonal: There is no material connection between the old and the new product-market combinations anymore. You might potentially use one of your company's strengths (example: gas station becomes a mini supermarket).

Benefit: Diversification will make your company less dependent on individual products, product groups or business areas. This enables you to compensate for growth problems or market weaknesses in one area with a new area.

Risk: Diversification is meant to spread risk. However, this strategy carries high risks because you are supposed to start operating in new markets with new products. You have to expect high upfront costs for market analyses, product developments, marketing measures, and brand development, as well as the cost of investment in new infrastructures.

---


# FUTURE/DISRUPTIVE STRATEGIES 

## 12. OFFERING IDENTIFICATION: FUTURE OFFERINGS + EXISTING/FAMILIAR MARKETS

Idea: Identification of innovative or disruptive offerings for existing or familiar markets.

Implementation: Utilization of a new operational and/or financial approach (example: fintech startups) to create an offering portfolio that is good enough for the lower mainstream segment according to the prevailing standards of the sector or the market.

Benefit: You address oversupplied customers in the lower segment of the mainstream market with discount prices. You achieve cost advantages and profit margins that are required to win business at the lower end of the market.

Risk: High risk because there is no empirical data available for the new business model or for market acceptance. That is why disruptive business models must be separated from core business.

## 13. MARKET IDENTIFICATION: EXISTING/MODIFIED OFFERINGS + FUTURE MARKETS/CUSTOMER SEGMENTS

Idea: Identify future markets for an existing or modified offering (example: Cirque du Soleil).

Implementation: You reduce the "traditional" attributes of your service in your offering (Cirque du Soleil: no animals) but increase the service by improving retained attributes or by adding new attributes (Cirque du Soleil: world-class acrobatics combined with excellent musical theater) and thus create a better customer experience.

Benefit: You target non-consumers with this: customers who in the past did not have the willingness or capacity to pay to consume the offering.

Risk: The business model must be profitable with low prices per unit sold and with initially small production volumes. Gross margin per unit sold will be markedly lower. Disruptive business models must be separated from core business.

---


14. FUTURE DIVERSIFICATION: NEW/FUTURE OFFERINGS + NEW CUSTOMER SEGMENTS/FUTURE MARKETS OR CUSTOMER SEGMENTS

Idea: Identify or create a blue ocean, a market with little or no competition (example: AMAZON's cloud server offering AWS).

# Implementation: 

- Forge radical new paths
- Redefine the rules of success
- Create an uncontested marketplace with new demand
- Break down the relationship between customer benefit, price, and costs
- Orient your entire system of corporate activities to striving for differentiation and low costs
- Participate in innovative startups or acquire one

Benefit: If you find a combination like this and are a "first mover", you will be operating in a market with great future potential and high profits but little competition.

Risk: You are making a bet on the future. Naturally, that is extremely risky. There are no guarantees whatsoever. Even the best situation analyses won't help here. That is why disruptive business models must be separated from core business.

---


# DETERMINE CHALLENGES 

In this phase, it makes sense to name the major challenges for your company. These should be derived clearly from the risks-and-opportunities profiles and the options identified. A strategy and its target vision are seldom completely indeterminate. After all, you are operating in a conflict area between your "own realities" and the realities of your environment.

Generally, there will be several challenges you will have to face with your strategy. Clearly naming these challenges is a call to action and helps set the correct focus for your target vision. Additionally, you will create the sense of urgency that constitutes a vital component of the narrative (storyline) of your strategy.

## COMMUNICATION

The insights formulated in the workshop will form the basis for the first component in a coherent line of reasoning to explain your strategy. Ideally, linking up your answers to the following key questions in a coherent way will illustrate both the necessity and urgency for a new strategy and make it comprehensible:

- Why do we have to change?
- Why do we have to act just now?
- Which external factors are forcing us to make conclusive decisions?
- What internal homework do we have to do?
- Where can we build on our strengths?
- Which challenges do we have to concentrate on?


## TIP

Review these bullet-point questions and the acquired answers after the workshop for consistency of formulation.

---


# CHALLENGES 

Once you completed formulating the insights from the situation analysis during Strategy Workshop I, you and your team must take the next step and clarify the key challenges to master. If the implications, courses of action and their consequences are not clear, there will be no urgency to act, and there will also be no indication of whether you are on the right path to realizing the target vision. You can address the three steps - implications, courses of action, and consequences - in a group discussion. In this way, participants can explain their viewpoints openly as regards the results of the analysis and the insights.

## KEY QUESTIONS:

For 1. RETREAT: Which markets or offerings are stagnating or losing?
For 2. PRODUCT-CONSTANT MARKET CONSOLIDATION: In which markets are your offerings not profitable?
For 3. MARKET CONSTANT PRODUCT CONSOLIDATION: Which offerings are not profitable in your markets?
For 4. MARKET PENETRATION: Where do you have yet untapped potential?
For 5. PRODUCT MODIFICATION: How can a modified offering cover additional requirements or encourage established customers to purchase higher volumes?

For 6. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: How can your customers' requirements be satisfied in a different way?
For 7. MARKET EXPANSION: In which other regions of the world are there similar requirements?
For 8. LIMITED DIVERSIFICATION: In which regions of the world are there similar requirements which you can satisfy with modified offerings?

For 9.1. PARTIAL DIVERSIFICATION: Which new sectors are lucrative?
For 9.2. PARTIAL DIVERSIFICATION: Which target group could you serve profitably by modifying your offerings?
For 10. MARKET DEVELOPMENT: Which other target groups can benefit from your offerings?
For 11. DIVERSIFICATION: How could requirements develop in three, five or ten years?
For 12. OFFERING IDENTIFICATION: Are there new operational or financial approaches for satisfying basic requirements at discount prices?

For 13. MARKET IDENTIFICATION: Can you gain current non-customers by offering new product attributes?
For 14. FUTURE DIVERSIFICATION: Can you see undeveloped markets where new demand could emerge?

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR IMPLICATIONS:

1. List the expected implications for the individual insights from the modules.
2. In each case, describe how these could change the rules of success for your company or the sector.
3. Briefly describe the risks and opportunities.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR COURSES OF ACTION:

1. Reduce your courses of action: Based on the implications, you can now delete courses of action that are definitely out of the question in view of your risks-and-opportunities profile.
2. Create a range of options: Using the opportunities you have identified and working through the key questions, integrate the insights from the modules into individual courses of action.
3. Substantiate the courses of action: Underpin the options, if necessary, with data from the analysis.

# FORMULATE INSIGHTS 

## INSTRUCTIONS

Together, the implications with the highest risk and the courses of action with the highest probability will generate your concrete challenges. You can then formulate these with your team.

Naming this challenge is a "call to action" which puts the organization's strategy at the center of everything and gives it meaning.

## EXAMPLES

Here are a few examples of the challenges you could be confronted with:

- Our competitors are extending their cost leadership over us, and we are losing market share in our core business.
- Our product portfolio is too complex and negatively impacted by loss-makers.
- We have to adapt our sales channels to address new customer segments better.
- We have to reverse our market share losses in our most important brands.
