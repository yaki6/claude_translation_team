Operationalize your objectives and key results and fill them out with initiatives, projects, and measures. To do this, you need a translation into the language for going down the path that should lead you to the realization of your target vision. You should therefore transform your objectives with their key results into gap statements that describe the current and the desired future state of the organization for each objective. From these you can derive the obstacles that must be overcome to realize the desired future.

In this way, you will create an understanding for the reality of your shared strategy journey and enable progress to be measured, obstacles to be eliminated and successes to be celebrated. You will put the strategic agenda into the spotlight with specified initiatives, projects, and measures as well as defined time frames. Hand over responsibility to your management team for closing the gaps across all the objectives. This will also prevent a potential silo mentality which will emerge at the latest when you are "cascading" the strategy into the individual business areas, departments, and teams. Install one main manager per objective from your management team. This will make progress measurable. You will not get lost in the minutiae of endless reporting meetings, Excel sheets or complicated program management landscapes.

## GEAR YOUR BUSINESS SYSTEM TO THE STRATEGY

Although closing the gaps is of decisive importance, it is not enough. For your strategy to lead to success, all the elements of your organization's action system must be effectively geared to this strategy. The existing organization embodies the action system for yesterday's strategy. Now the system has to be aligned with the strategy for tomorrow.

An organization's action system must function holistically, like an ecosystem where each part supports the other parts. Strategy needs consistency - the elements must fit together like the pieces of a jigsaw - and coherence - all activities must dovetail into one another like the cogs in a clock movement. If one single element does not play its supporting role or if the elements work against each other, your strategy will get bogged down. To ensure this does not happen, you must process the six elements of your action system as action areas:

---


# 1. STRUCTURES \& PROCESSES 

What do you have to adapt structurally and process-wise? This is not just about structures and processes as a whole and overall, but also in the individual units (like departments). For example, a new sales approach can make it necessary to change from the classic sales model to an e-commerce model which requires new structures and processes.

What does your process landscape look like? Are your current processes documented comprehensibly? What do the processes that are ideal for tomorrow look like? How can you design these "end to end", automate them if necessary, and implement them?

## 2. PEOPLE

Do you have the right team with the right competencies on board? Are your management levels filled with the right people? Do you have clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and hierarchies? Where do you have to expand, reduce, or relocate resources? Are new competencies needed? What training course or coaching do your employees need to get to the level that is relevant for your strategy?

Nothing works without the human resource. In an aging and shrinking society, this resource is becoming increasingly scarce and the market therefore increasingly competitive. It stopped being just a "war for talent", a battle for new recruits, a long time ago. Increasingly frequently and in future probably to an even greater extent, employees must take on changing tasks and roles. Finding capable and motivated employees, and especially keeping them, is a challenge. How are you facing this challenge? Is your company attractive enough as an employer, or does it need new incentives? Have you institutionalized employee development? Is there a talent pool? How do you foster this? Is there a succession management program?

## 3. CULTURE

Are your corporate, management and work cultures suitable for realizing your strategic target vision? What values are your actions based on? How much "boss and subordinates" thinking is in your management culture? Do you have an error culture? Can a "cooperative management system" make it easier to achieve your objectives? Do you need stronger self-management or decentralization? What role do "New Work elements" play?

---


You should ask yourself these questions - and probably a few more as well - because the action area is very diverse. As diverse as your company. Sit down with your team and think about what sort of management is necessary for tomorrow and how the cooperative process should be designed.

# 4. DATA \& IT 

Nothing works without a digital backbone anymore. Is your IT infrastructure future-proof? Have you set up your system landscape for the future? Do you need to harmonize your system and application landscape so that you can manage the various parts of the company better? Do you need specific digital solutions to achieve the objectives you have set?

But it does not stop at software and hardware systems. What do you actually do with your data? Nothing, a bit, or have you already been gripped by collecting mania? What about your data structure? Are screws given a different inventory number per business unit in every ERP system? Have you established a master data management system?

## 5. INNOVATION

Is innovation hardwired into your organization's DNA, or is it a foreign concept? How do you deal with trends? Do you manage them actively, or does only your research and development department handle them? How do you identify new trends, and how are these incorporated into new product development? Is there a systematic process for this? How do you measure your innovation capacity? How much money do you invest in the future survival of your company?

## 6. PARTNERS

Companies are now foregoing cooperation with other companies to protect assumed competitive advantages. In this case, because of secretiveness and fearing a loss of control, companies prefer to do everything themselves although they would have been able to take advantage of cost-cutting or value-enhancing complementarities in a cooperative arrangement. Without openness to cooperation, the complexity of today's world cannot be overcome anymore.

Do you cooperate with other companies across your value chain? Do you have the right partners? What will you still do yourself in the future, and what will you buy in from other companies or service providers? Who do you want to cooperate with?

---


# ACCELERATE CHANGE AND CREATE A PERCEPTION OF SUCCESS 

After the action areas have been filled, you now have to draw up a roadmap. Kotter's (2014) approach with its eight accelerators of change has proved to be practicable. Your task is not to draw up a detailed plan of your "transformation", but to set a general course and also determine the right dramaturgy to eliminate resistance and build a network of supporters strategically. You will not develop a comprehensive and in-depth implementation concept until you reach the "Transformation" process step.

As soon as you have completed this process step with your team, you face the task of meeting your stakeholders (shareholders, investors, all management executives, and of course all employees) where they are at, convincing them of your plan and getting them on board for the strategy journey. Because of this, planning your communication takes on a key role.

With the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\circledR}$ you have already laid the foundation for the content of a storyline that will make the connections transparent and provide clarity on the "why". But it is not enough to simply distribute the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\circledR}$. An entire potpourri of communication measures is required to gather your team behind the new strategy.

# STRATEGY WORKSHOP II 

The second strategy workshop should take place about 4 to 6 weeks after the first workshop and after the final linguistic reformulation of the insights. This will enable you to keep the momentum going and close the gaps to the action areas.

## KEY QUESTIONS \& TIPS:

## 1. When and where will the strategy workshop be held?

In our experience, a time lag of 4 to 6 weeks after Workshop I is ideal. Remember to send out an invitation in good time to the broader management team. We recommend that you go "offsite" for this workshop as well and therefore leave your familiar habitat to create mental space to think and act.

## 2. How long should the strategy workshop take?

You should plan for 1.5 days to have enough time to get the new participants on board, identify gaps and develop suitable measures. As for Strategy Workshop I, we recommend starting the evening beforehand, eating dinner together and then hitting the ground running the next day.

## 3. Who should participate in the strategy workshop?

To make sure you don't just stew in your own juice, we recommend expanding the circle of participants deliberately to 20 to 30 people. Then you can work in five breakout groups across the five objectives with four to six participants per group. When you are expanding the circle, avoid getting too many worrywarts around the table. Instead, concentrate on initiators who will subsequently be able to act in a kind of strategic network and lend additional acceleration to the strategy process.

## 4. Who will be moderating the strategy workshop?

The task of the five objective teams is to develop targeted measures. You can pass over team responsibility to the experienced colleagues from your management team or from Workshop I. Then the strategy sponsor in tandem with the strategy process manager can take over moderation and coordination. Experience in working with this size of group is a clear advantage here. Of course, you can also call in an external moderator, especially if you would like to contribute yourself to developing the content in one of the objective teams.

# TACKLE ACTION AREAS 

What do you want to address specifically? How will you gear your entire organization to the new strategy? How can potential obstacles be overcome?

## KEY QUESTIONS:

1. To what extent is the "current state" of our organization suitable for achieving the "objective"?
2. What will the "target state" of our organization look like when we have achieved the "objective"?
3. Which "obstacles" do we have to remove to reach the "target state"?
4. Which initiatives, projects and measures do we have to launch with which deadline to close the gap?
5. Looking at our organization's six action areas, what do we have to change with specific initiatives, projects, and measures to gear the organization to the objective?

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Please make as many copies of the action area map with the front and back pages as you have objectives or use the download function to work digitally.
2. Write your objective into the work page of the action area map or transfer it to a flipchart. Explain or add to the key results for the objective.
3. As a team, describe the "current state" of the organization. Write down the individual descriptions and attributes on the map or the Metaplan board.
4. As a team, describe the "target state": how the organization will look when the objective is achieved. Write down the individual descriptions and attributes on the map or the Metaplan board.
5. Derive the gaps between the "current state" and the "target state" by getting every participant to write down potential obstacles for achieving the objective on a card and pinning it up.
6. Develop creative solutions for how you want to overcome these obstacles with initiatives, projects, and measures. Classify these into the six action areas of your business system.
7. In the last step of your group work, add to the action areas the initiatives, projects, and measures that you have to change on the individual parameters to gear your business system to the strategy completely. You can also put existing measures into these categories if they already pay into the new strategy.
8. The entire group now votes on the most important measures for each objective and action area. Every participant gets five votes.
9. Now please transfer the selected initiatives, projects, and measures into the appropriate action areas in the frame.

## TIP

When you are working in small groups, you should use the action area map or set up two Metaplan boards for the group work, one for the "current state" and one for the "target state" of your organization. Between them you can set up a flipchart on which you write the objective you worked on and list underneath it the obstacles you identified in the work session.

If an "objective" is too abstract for processing in the group, you should use the "key results" you have defined.

You can use the action area map for listing the initiatives, projects, and measures across the six action areas of the organization (digital or analog). Alternatively, you could use more sides of a Metaplan board.

# ROADMAP II FOR COMMUNICATION 

## GENERATE MOMENTUM FOR THE NEW DEPARTURE

"The single biggest problem with communication is the illusion that it has taken place."

George Bernard Shaw, Irish playwright and politician

The action areas have been filled in. You have released the subservient strategy genie from their bottle, but that does not mean that it has been accepted within the organization. Now the magic word is strategy communication. You have to spread the "good news": We have a new plan. You will tell your shareholders, employees, and other interest groups (investors, analysts, banks, ...) where you are headed. That initially sounds like a one-way street, like "top-down" and, "We're talking, you'll listen and implement". But it's not that easy. Not everyone will instantly get all fired up about what you have developed with your management team and internal multipliers, because a new strategy means change. And the prospect of change stokes fears, particularly among employees, of being put on the "reject" pile and left behind. You therefore have to do a lot of convincing and win over the stakeholders to your plan. It should not come as a surprise to anyone nowadays that communication is the key to successful mediation and implementation. Unfortunately, the reality often looks different. A dialog idealistically envisaged to involve all participants quickly turns into a monologue that trails off at the second management level and never reaches the lower echelons of corporate headquarters. That is why you need a plan here, too, for how you want to get the "storyline" of the new strategy across to the entire workforce.
