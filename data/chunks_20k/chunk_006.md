# STRATEGY INTERVIEWS 

## GET QUALITATIVE INSIGHTS

A major challenge for strategy developers lies in reaching a shared understanding of the strategy process among the management team. Without such an understanding it will be difficult to make meaningful strategic decisions. The interviews make a decisive contribution to achieving this goal because the respondents' diverging perspectives, assumptions and sensitivities become visible and can be clarified.

If you don't ask, you don't want to know. But if you do ask, you will get answers from the situation analysis. A successful situation analysis will highlight what your company has achieved up to the present day, where its strengths lie, and which areas need work. As a commercial enterprise, your work has to be based on figures and you have to keep your "key performance indicators" in your sights. Hence your situation analysis won't work without figures. That is why a key portion of the results of your situation analysis will be quantitative.

Perception complements the figures

However, if spreadsheets are presented and screens are filled with rows of numbers, people can easily become unable to see the wood for the trees. That is why it is important, in our experience, to illustrate a company's internal and external realities with qualitative instruments as well as, for example, with exploratory interviews.

## SEMI-STRUCTURED EXPLORATORY INTERVIEWS

The exploratory interview is a form of qualitative survey. It can be held personally, orally and in person or virtually. Thus, apart from what is said, the interviewee's non-verbal communication can also be observed. You should choose a dialog-oriented discussion format since a process that is limited to a question-and-answer sequence could be experienced by the interviewees as an "interrogation" - especially when there are sensitive questions involved.

We also recommend that you structure the discussion beforehand based on key questions on the topics in the situation analysis that you would like to address but without planning the entire discussion minutely. The benefit of a "semistructured interview" like this is that the interviewees see themselves as dialog partners and you are giving them intellectual space to respond, ask their own questions and discuss. It is important to emphasize to the interviewees that the object of the interview is not to substantiate or refute existing hypotheses on the quantitative results. Instead, the aim is to gather as many impressions, opinions, attitudes, or suggestions as time-efficiently as possible. The interviewees' subjective perceptions can then be used on the one hand to gain insights that permit

better comprehension of the quantitative results. On the other hand, causal relationships and development patterns can emerge over and above the interviews that cannot be derived from the quantitative data on its own.

# VOLUNTARY, ANONYMOUS, OPEN 

But now who should interview whom to gain the best possible insights? The first question to answer is who should be interviewed because you might possibly have some surveys already, for example, from customers. Basically, you should be aiming to get a $360^{\circ}$ view - but maybe this is not feasible because of budget or time factors. In that case, we suggest that you prioritize from inside to outside:

1. Internal key people (participating management team before other groups of people)
2. Important internal or external stakeholders
3. Active customers and non-customers
4. External experts

After the key people in the organization as well as the owners and employees, then come the external stakeholders, first and foremost the customers, and other externals.

You should schedule around 6 to 8 weeks for a solid exploratory survey, including analysis - irrespective of the number of interviewees and the number of interviewers. This brings us to two central, but often conflicting, topics: Who should conduct the interviews? And how do we ensure that the people being interviewed are not evasive, but are open and share their unfiltered opinions?

The qualitative analysis is time-consuming, but it can make a decisive difference in achieving significant advances in insight. You will gain an understanding of the psyche of the people in your company, whether they are executives, regular employees, or shareholders, and you get insight into what they think about the present state and future of your company, what expectations and needs they have. The same applies to your customers and their expectations, wishes, and preferences. In brief: As long as people are still responsible for strategy, the additional expenditure for a survey is worthwhile. Our recommendation: Question, query, and challenge. It pays off.

# STRATEGY INTERVIEWS 

On the following worksheets we have compiled all the information you need to conduct your strategy interviews successfully. Apart from specifying the procedure, tips and comments, we also propose potential key questions across the entire StrategyFrame ${ }^{\circledR}$ in the core module Situation Analysis.

## INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Prepare the interviews:

- Define interview groups
- Prepare a questionnaire with key questions
- Invite the interview participants and arrange interview times

2. Conduct the interviews ( 60 to 90 minutes)

- Short presentation
- Start digital recording
- Steer the interview using key questions

3. Evaluate the interviews

- Transcribe the recorded interviews
- Form clusters along the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\circledR}$
- Code the statements
- Mark illustrative quotes

4. Incorporate insights into the modules of the situation analysis

- Add observations to each module with illustrative quotes


## TIP

- Number of interviews: 10 to max. 35 (if you have more interviews, the time and effort required for evaluation rises enormously, but the insights gained do not)
- Duration of each interview: at least 45 to max. 90 mins.
- Interviews per day: no more than 3
- Ask open questions: This enables a discussion to develop
- Query, query, query: Use simple query words like "why", to dig deeper
- Be an active listener
- Code systematically: Use software for the repetitive work


## CAUTION

If you wish to interview employees in your company, you should clarify whether you need approval from your company union or works council (if you have one) to do this. When we conduct our internal surveys in the strategy process, we try to stay on the current management levels. You cannot force anyone to take part in a survey or to give their permission to make their opinion public. Voluntary participation and guaranteed anonymity are fundamental prerequisites for openness among the interviewees. If there is no willingness to be open among the interviewees, you will not get all the information you need from them for your strategy process.

Although you can certainly contact external stakeholders independently, it will be difficult to conduct a survey neutrally within your own company and evaluate it objectively - irrespective of how good your company culture and mutual trust are (or are perceived to be).

For these reasons, it totally makes sense to call in external support here to conduct the survey impartially, ensure anonymous evaluation of the results and communicate them credibly.

# QUESTIONNAIRE 

The following elements should help you draft a questionnaire that is adapted to your purposes to conduct semi-structured interviews. Conduct the interviews in person or digitally as dialog-based meetings by working through the key questions. Your focus should be on letting your interview partner speak freely and openly. Your priority will be to listen. Your key questions will provide the thematic framework. They might have to be adapted for the various stakeholder groups.

## INSTRUCTIONS:

The following basic ground rules apply to the interviews:

1. A clearly defined time frame ( $45-90$ minutes is ideal)
2. The interviewer's openness and neutrality
3. Strict preservation of anonymity of results
4. Destruction of all recordings after evaluation

Why are we conducting this interview? We would like to know...
... where does our company stand today? ... how is our environment developing? ... what is our biggest challenge? ... how does our company plan to win the competition for customers? ... how will we implement our strategy?

## WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE RESULTS?

The insights gained will be incorporated into the development of your future strategy.

# PUT CUSTOMERS FIRST 

In our digital times, a customer-centered approach is considered the sole deciding factor for a company to succeed in business. This is so easy to say, write and promise - but has not yet found its way into many companies' reality. Because customer centricity requires a fundamental change of perspective - and thus a shift from navel-gazing at your own company to a consistent orientation to customers and their requirements.

Companies that are less exposed to competition find it particularly hard to maintain a customer perspective and orientation. Sheer product availability with consistent product quality is still an unbeatable reason for customers to remain loyal, even if companies do not treat them well. But their luxurious position of strength with respect to customers is crumbling. Unexpected external shocks like the Covid-19 pandemic and the gas crisis due to the Russian aggression in Ukraine have now reached the Isles of the Blest too. Supply disruptions, production bottlenecks and rising inflation are changing customer requirements, customer preferences and willingness to pay. The demand side is moving, but the supply side is at a standstill and licking its wounds. Many companies have already had to bid farewell to the glory days of "everything goes".

When you have customer centricity, you attune yourself lock, stock and barrel to identifying and satisfying your customers' needs. You develop new products, services, or even new business models from a customer perspective. This approach affects all areas of a company and therefore is of considerable significance, if not to say decisive importance, for your corporate strategy.

When you are going through your strategic considerations, you must know what challenges and opportunities exist on your demand side. Who are "your" customers, both current and potential, how do they behave, what do they need, what are their pain points, and what are their preferences? Who are your noncustomers, and why?

# CLOSE PROXIMITY TO CUSTOMERS 

"We know our customers very well, and we know what they need." That is awesome but unfortunately rarely true. Our experience from various projects with companies shows: When we ask when someone from the management team last visited a customer and was able to watch them using the company's product(s), we are usually met with deafening silence.

Let us take a closer look at some of the myths about analyzing customers. Test yourself on these honestly:

## \#1: CUSTOMERS' REQUIREMENTS ARE CHANGING WAY TOO FAST

Customers' requirements change, there is no question about that. Fulfilled requirements disappear, new requirements emerge, preferences shift focus. Established customers with familiar preferences leave, new customers with different expectations and preferences come on board. How fast this happens is a different question because it takes some time before people change their behaviors. This is how cheap meat products can still sell well even in boom times for healthy nutrition and meat substitute products.

## STORIES FROM THE FIELD

The vegetarian curried sausage delivers a good example. When car maker VW replaced the classic curried sausage with a vegetarian and a vegan version in its company canteen in the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg in 2021, the outcry to save the curried sausage was huge in social media across Germany - even coming from a former German chancellor.

However, the fact that the meat version is on offer in 30 of the automotive manufacturer's other company canteens in Wolfsburg alone, and that every year around 7 million (2019) portions of the cult sausage leave the group's own butcher's shop, speaks for itself. In addition, the original version of the "curry bockwurst" can be bought by specialist retailers under the product number "199 3985000 A" and by consumers in various retail chains. Like the Germans' love of cash, the meat bockwurst will still have its fans for a long time to come, even if vegetarian success stories like Rügenwalder Mühle address new requirements specifically and highly successfully.

# \#2: CUSTOMERS DO NOT KNOW THEIR OWN REQUIREMENTS 

All too often, executives and particularly sales professionals can be heard saying that customers do not know their own requirements at all. What they mean is: We know better what customers really want and need and develop new targeted products accordingly. To illustrate this, product innovations like Apple's iPod and iPhone, which Steve Jobs pushed onto the market, are often happily rolled out. But even these top sellers are based on previously known and clear consumer requirements (for example, Sony's Walkman as a portable miniature cassette player).

## \#3: CUSTOMERS CANNOT ARTICULATE THEIR REQUIREMENTS

That is not true. Or at least, as Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson (1938) argues in his "revealed preferences theory", the ultimate buying decision reveals the customers' preferences for the goods they just purchased. However, that means that we do not yet know what tipped the scales in favor of the purchase in the end (the price, suitable product features, the immediate availability, or something else). But even if customers do not articulate their requirements directly, they can be observed in certain circumstances.

When you conduct the situation analysis it makes sense to use various methods to find out something about customers' requirements as well as their prioritization and change. Field tests like customer shadowing or testing out prototypes in design thinking processes are common methods for identifying customer requirements. At the same time, you should investigate how your competitors' products satisfy these customer requirements.

# CUSTOMERS 

Do you understand your customers' most important requirements and expectations? Understanding always starts with listening and looking! There are many ways to reach a goal. Depending on your existing data pool, budget, and deadline, you should observe or interview your customers, or consult external analysts. On this point, experience shows: The more insights you get into your customers' most visceral expectations and experiences, the better for your understanding. Our recommendation: Leave your desk now and again and head out to the front lines, to your customers.

## KEY QUESTIONS:

1. Which customer segments are relevant for us?
2. Which customers do we want to address, and which don't we?
3. How have our customers' demands and requirements changed from yesterday to today? How will they change from today to tomorrow?
4. Which requirements are most important to our target customers?
5. How well do we fulfill these requirements today?
6. How well do our competitors fulfill these requirements today?
