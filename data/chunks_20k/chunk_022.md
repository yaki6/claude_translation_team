# THANKS FROM BOTH OF US 

Corporate strategies are seldom conceived and brought to life by individuals acting alone. If strategists take time out to think, they need other people to look after the day-to-day routine and keep the business running. That's why we are firmly convinced that strategy making is teamwork. And teamwork always works when we follow a shared target vision.

Writing a book is teamwork too - but not so much, because this book has two authors with a shared target vision. Instead, we would not have been capable of putting our thoughts, experiences, and insights to digital paper if we hadn't had many supporters who shared our target vision, took over our tiresome daily routines and necessities patiently and indulgently during the writing phase and inspired, motivated and corrected us sympathetically.
