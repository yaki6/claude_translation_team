It seems self-evident that the various business area, market, and functional strategies must be embedded at the corporate or group level. In practice, however, business area and function managers are increasingly finding themselves confronted with a lack of strategic considerations at the highest level. According to a study conducted by consultancy firm strategy\& (2019), fewer than one-third of German companies have a clearly defined strategy that goes beyond general statements. If it is unclear how the deployment of resources pays into the company account and what the specific expectations from "above" entail, a certain arbitrariness ensues in the actions of all decision-makers. Not surprisingly, a silo mentality then spreads and prevents an integrative strategy that is oriented towards the challenges and opportunities.

# \#2: WHICH OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE ARE YOU PURSUING WITH YOUR STRATEGY AND WHICH IS YOUR FOCUS? 

What are your strategic considerations really about? Should the current business model be questioned? Are we talking about a reorientation of core business? Should new business fields/business models be developed, or should a dual approach be pursued that combines both and drives them forward in parallel? Before you get into specific questions like these, it is important to understand what the strategic challenges are. Rumelt (2022) differentiates between three types of strategic challenges.

In the first type of challenge, the "choice challenge", you can understand the cause-and-effect connections and know alternative solutions. Your challenge comprises making the optimum decision amid conditions of uncertainty and not entirely quantifiable risks. Elon Musk had a production plant, a gigafactory, built in Berlin-Brandenburg to be able to cater to the anticipated rise in demand for e-vehicles in Germany and Europe. This meant that he entered into a longer-term commitment to this production location. Undoubtedly Musk and his strategists had alternative locations as well as alternative sizes of production plants on their analysis list. But Musk is known not to shy away from risk, and he therefore, unsurprisingly, chose the "no half measures" option.

In the second type of challenge, the "engineering design challenge" there are no predefined or known alternative solutions from which the best is chosen by weighing up costs and benefits. A new solution is required. But at least there are examples or blueprints from previous experience or from observation of how others proceeded in similar situations. Then the nascent new approach can be tested against these models. In the past decades, German discount grocery retailers Aldi and Lidl have entered various new foreign markets. Although every national market has its peculiarities, these companies utilize tried and tested entry and expansion models and additionally used the new environments for experimenting (Business Insider Deutschland, 2018).

The third type of challenge, the "gnarly design challenge", is particularly tricky, as it describes a situation that requires a decision where there are no known alternatives and no transferable action templates for the strategy that is sought. Interdependencies are unclear, relevant information is lacking, and available data can be interpreted in many different ways very differently. According to Kay and King (2020), there is "radical uncertainty":
1. Choice challenge
2. Engineering design challenge
3. Gnarly design challenge

"The result of our incomplete knowledge of the world, or about the connection between our present actions and their future outcomes. (...) There are things we do not know, and things we do not know that we do not know. And sometimes things we do know that are just not so."

Clarity about the type of strategic challenge will help you to define the "focus" of the strategy you wish to develop and conduct the right analyses. In our practical experience, the focus of strategies is generally on one of the following four areas:

# PORTFOLIO: 

Growth (Invest)
Stabilization (Hold)
Shrinkage (Disinvest)

## PRODUCTS/MARKETS:

Market penetration
Market development
Product development
Portfolio diversification

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES/MARKET COVERAGE:

Cost leadership
Product differentiation
Concentration (entire market or niche)

## MARKET BEHAVIOR:

Attack
Defense
Win-win

---


PORTFOLIO (Corporate/group level)
(BCG Matrix, Henderson 1970): This is about the optimum allocation of your limited resources to the various corporate units. In which business fields do you want to grow? Growth requires investments. Where should you maintain your current market position? Where do you want to pare back your commitments to free up resources?

PRODUCTS/MARKETS (Business field/market level)
(Ansoff Matrix, Ansoff 1965): Do you want to penetrate existing markets with your current products (for example, by enhancing marketing measures) and increase your market share? Do you want to develop existing markets for your company with new products? Do you want to enter new markets with your current products and develop these markets for your company? Or do you want to diversify and establish new products in new markets?

POSITIONING AMONG THE COMPETITION (Business field/market level)
(Porter's Five Forces, Porter 1980): Do you want to stand out from your competitors in the selected business fields or markets by clear "differentiation" in terms of price and quality, or by "cost leadership"? Where should you direct your "concentration" - onto the entire market, or onto a niche?

# MARKET BEHAVIOR (Market level) 

Do you want to stage a frontal attack on the competition with the aim of market penetration and capture market share from them, as DHL attempted to do a few years ago in the USA against FedEx and UPS? Or do you want to act defensively instead, and not expose yourself on the entire market so that you do not trigger intense resistance from established market participants? Red Bull chose a defensive approach when it entered the US energy drink market to avoid counterstrikes from dominant firms Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Maybe you can also create win-win situations, for example, by increasing overall demand through your market development activities - and your competitors would profit from this as well.

Irrespective of whether your task is now to cut down your known alternatives (long list) to, for example, the best three (shortlist) to enable the optimum choice of a solution, or a complex challenge like growth in a saturated market environment: Clarify the type of strategic challenge with your management team, stake out your playing fields, and define the focus of your strategy.

"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world."
Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus logico-philosophicus, 1918
If we want to develop and implement a strategy, we do not just need shared understanding at the content level. We must also speak a common language in our internal and external communication. Because language creates reality. That is one interpretation of the Wittgenstein quotation. A shared language, or rather, shared speech, creates closeness, commitment, and connection.

That is why you should not just call a spade a spade even before you set out on your strategy journey. You should also give your undertaking an inspirational description. In our daily business routines, the names given to strategies or strategy processes are usually not ever inventive, for example, "Strategy 2025", "Steel Strategy 20-30" or simply "Our Strategy". We have nothing against pragmatism and practicality unless it is just a mask for pure lack of imagination. But if a strategy is meant to really engage and inspire an organization, then a certain amount of emotionality and a strong message are needed inwardly as well as outwardly. So why not speak of "Bold Moves" instead of "Strategy 2025"? Or like Bertelsmann give your strategy a headline that emphasizes what it is about and what is at stake? - "Tomorrow is already here."

Language is not just decisive for naming and formulating a strategy. In fact, you should consider which language you wish to conduct your strategy process in. In many multinational companies, English is the working language. However, there are often no native English speakers among the participating decision-makers, or very few. Varying language skills among participants could distort the substance of the discussions, give native speakers the last word in interpreting terminology and change the balance of power in the strategy process. This problem is a major issue, even in international top teams at the corporate level. One of the authors of this book recently experienced this again in a strategy workshop with company area managers of an international corporation. English was agreed with the board of management as the workshop language. However, after a short time, it turned out that the language skills in the group varied too much to enable the participants to process terminology, content, and questions well and in a reasonable time to enable meaningful discussion. Even for participants with other native languages, switching to German was better than sticking with English. So, be sure to give some thought to language at an early stage and consider its effects on your strategy process.

# \#4: WHAT HALF-LIFE SHOULD YOUR STRATEGY HAVE? 

The question of a period of relevance for a strategy is difficult to answer in today's "VUCA" world. The best answer is an economist's typical answer: it depends - on the company, the sector, and all the other factors that we want to include in our situation analysis. We do not know, and we cannot know, how volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous the future will be. From our observations and analysis within companies and their respective business contexts, the half-life of corporate strategies emerges as a time corridor from about 3 to a maximum of 5 years.

Whether it is more or fewer years in the end: Strategy is not carved in stone. Depending on changes in market conditions and under pressure from competition, certain strategy elements (such as product strategy) can become obsolete faster than others (for example, operations strategy). That is why they should be reviewed at shorter intervals and require a more agile approach when new challenges or opportunities arise. The speed at which a corporate strategy can be adapted essentially depends on the size of the company. Experience shows that large companies require at least 2 to 3 years to develop a new strategy, implement it within the organization and make it tangible to customers.

## \#5: WHAT BASIS WILL THE STRATEGY BE REORIENTED ON?

Do you have a corporate mission statement that anchors your strategy, that explains the company's purpose, defines its identity, determines the set of values and fundamental principles for your own actions and derives the vision and the work assignment for the organization? If not, then we recommend that you develop and communicate this type of self-perception before you turn your attention to the strategy work. A mission statement and a strategy should not be developed together or in parallel, since both the focus as well as the thought and communications methods are not identical.

If you have a mission statement, you should review it because it will not always be transferable 1:1 onto a new strategy. To obtain the content required for the strategy process without running two processes in parallel and nonetheless achieving the best possible outcome, we work in practice with an "impact statement" - a promise to all stakeholders about how you plan to generate a positive effect with your company in your field of activity in the longer term (time frame: 5 to 10 years).

The impact statement is a blend of your passion, your company's strengths and the impetus of your economic engine. This is how it connects your "Why" (Sinek, 2019) to a big motivating objective that you want to bring to life (Sinek, 2011). You should position your impact statement in the target vision to generate momentum and give the blend a viable basis.

Strategy development: 3 to 6 months

Strategy implementation: 1 year

## \#6: WHAT IS THE TIME FRAME FOR YOUR STRATEGY PROCESS?

Before we go any further: Take your time on the strategy process. You won't develop a good strategy in 2 weeks. A sprint in the wrong direction will not take you any closer to your goal. Generally, there is a deadline for delivering your strategy message, for example, the annual shareholders' meeting, the supervisory or advisory board meeting, or the Financials press conference. Then this deadline will define the final date when at least the process of strategy development must be concluded.

If you want to conduct a robust and reliable situation analysis, you should plan for at least 4 to 8 weeks. This can also be achieved faster with high resource deployment and utilization of external consultants. It depends largely on the scope of the interview and data work required (collection, pooling, evaluation), because it won't work without solid quantitative and qualitative assessment. Excessive time pressure is counterproductive. It poses the risk of quick-fire decisions based on "gut feeling".

Once you have the results of the situation analysis, we recommend that you hold at least two workshops. The first workshop should take place with your top management team. The aim is to develop a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities that were identified and draft a target vision that is compatible with your mission statement. Then, within 2 to 4 weeks of the first workshop, the second should be held with the wider management team to test the robustness of the target vision and to translate it into concrete action areas with measures.

In total, you should allow for 3 to 6 months for strategy development. However, this step in the process should not take any longer because the world never stops turning. If it takes too long, your situation analysis could already be obsolete before you enter the phase of formulating objectives.

The results of your strategy development must then be brought into the organization and processed there. This should be feasible within a year. Of course, the type and size of company, its developmental stage and the focus of the strategy must be taken into account here.

When you are implementing your strategy, ensure the following:

- transparent communication - involve the implementers at an early stage and give them responsibility,
- intelligent coordination of the various activities - they must be coherent, meaning aligned with each other and working towards the same goal, and
- effective organization - define the roadmap and the milestones along the way, appoint a strategy process manager with executive authority.

A good strategy process requires a certain amount of agility and flexibility on the part of the strategy makers. Give your team space and time to maneuver.

# \#7: WHAT STRATEGY ARE YOU PURSUING AND HOW DOES A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRATEGY EMERGE? 

What elements are required to develop, communicate, and implement a complete strategy? There are multiple approaches, models, and methods you can use to develop an understanding of strategy and structure the strategy process. We are proponents of the KISS principle: "Keep it short and simple." That is why our StrategyFrame ${ }^{\circledR}$ comprises only three core elements: "Situation analysis", "Target vision" and "Action areas".

In our experience, it is important to get a panorama view that embeds these core elements into the overall context and acts as a platform for the joint work on content. When you have a view of the panorama, you can see the forest despite the trees. This makes it easier to reveal participants' expectations, attitudes and assumptions and clarify them.

## \#8: WHO IS SPONSORING THE STRATEGY PROCESS?

Classic sponsors of corporate strategy are company board members or directors. In practice, a team approach has frequently been called for in recent times. Yes, strategy work is teamwork, but responsibility is not divisible. Ultimately, there has to be one person with overall responsibility, even if several people share responsibility for the strategy. Otherwise, there is a danger that particular interest of individual participants could put a brake on the process. Concentration onto a single person with overall responsibility provides clarity on who has the final say, particularly in situations that are critical to the success of the process, and who will take the rap for it in the end.

People with an internal network and respect

Executives

## \#9: WHO WILL ACT AS OPERATIONAL STRATEGY PROCESS MANAGER?

In many cases, a full-time strategist or personal assistant to the management board is responsible for the coordination and operational control of a strategy process. It does not necessarily have to be the most experienced colleague who leads the strategy process. Fresh, young minds can also be suited for this position if they are well networked and recognized within the company. However, more important than choosing the person is to fill the position at an early stage and maintain it, if possible, beyond the strategy development process to prevent a breakdown between strategy development and strategy implementation.

## \#10: WHO SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE STRATEGY PROCESS AND HELP DEVELOP IT?

Co-creation involves the active co-development of the strategy, including people outside the core management team, but particularly getting those people on board at an early stage who are going to implement and execute the strategy later. In our observation, the top executives don't like "meddling" and therefore especially do not want strategy development to be a participatory process. However, it can be very beneficial to tone down your own ego and not just allow collaboration outside the inner circle but actively canvass for it to gain valuable stimulus for the process and acceptance of the strategy later. The co-creators have empirical knowledge and contribute different perspectives that help you to question your own strategic deliberations. Really good executives can be recognized by the fact that it is not beneath their dignity to let others participate in the strategy development process.

Let us encourage you: When you choose co-creation, you send a strong message to your organization. By taking co-development measures, you make the people involved into co-owners and multipliers of the emerging strategy and thus promote acceptance and willingness to implement. (Co-)ownership creates obligation. However, you will also raise expectations among the participants. They may pursue their own agendas, causing unforeseeable team dynamics to develop. For this reason, despite all your enthusiasm for a co-creation process, you have to be sure to strike the right balance. Just because everyone is involved in the development does not necessarily mean that the resulting strategy will be more to their taste, or to everyone's taste. A democratic grass-roots vote is not a suitable vehicle for deciding on a new strategy. You must therefore stipulate the limits of the co-creation process in transparent and clear communication. The scope and intensity of the involvement will depend on the respective step in the strategy process. Undoubtedly, the first strategy workshop cannot be a staff meeting. In the first instance, top management has to reach common insights and considerations. At this altitude, the number of participants should be kept low. Our experience shows that the effectiveness of these meetings de-
