# PREFACE 

We began in 2020 with our podcast "HOFFNUNG IST KEINE STRATEGIE" [HOPE IS NOT A STRATEGY]. During the many years we worked in management consultancy and management training, we discovered time and again that for many decision-makers, managers or employees, the word strategy denotes something mysterious, abstract, academic, or maybe even esoteric. And this is a fact despite an overwhelming range of university and non-academic management education and training courses, consultancy services of all flavors, smart specialist and reference books and countless "online tools". We wanted to demystify the "strategy" myth and find out why strategy work is often neglected, implemented poorly, or, if it is to be provided by third parties, regarded as unaffordable.

In short, when we considered the many podcast discussions with amazing strategists from all enterprise classes, from SMEs to big corporations, the countless comments and queries from our now more than five thousand subscribers, as well as our own experience, one thing became clear to us very quickly: The last word has not yet been said about strategy.

However, we do not have to reinvent the strategy wheel. On the contrary: We are convinced that all the theories, concepts and tools that are required for good strategy work already exist. To paraphrase Isaac Newton's famous quotation: We can see further by standing on the shoulders of strategy giants. But how do we best check what is already available for usefulness, merge it, and use it?

This "workbook" does that for you. You no longer need to shy away from the big word: "strategy". We will dispel your reservations and provide you with a tried and tested manual on how you can make your company flourish with a cleverly designed strategy process - from strategy development to implementation and beyond.

Learning is most effective when you can immediately try out or implement what you learned. The strategy process is an excellent place for organizational learning. Our workbook uses the "workflow learning" approach to provide you with precise contextual and timely support for your strategy work when you need it. In a continuous and transparent workflow, you develop the strategy with your team and implement it step by step. But that is not all: Our shared journey also leads into digital space: You will find all the materials in this book to download at www.campus.de/hopeisnotastrategy. If you wish to create your strategy in the digital domain, we offer you a brand-new strategy software and platform that can provide everything that your strategy process still lacks, or make it smarter and more effective, on www.Strategy-Frame.com.

Together, we will make strategy your new routine. From tomorrow, you will no longer train your operational muscle alone but your strategic muscle too at last. As we know, it is easier to stand on two legs.

We hope this book gives you strategic inspiration for your daily operations!

Sincerely,

# SUPREME DISCIPLINE OR WASTE OF TIME? 

"Strategy is a big word. Sometimes oversized. When it is used in a meeting, everyone solidifies into a pillar of salt, and everyone hopes for the Messiah who will show the way. But we must realize that strategy is often just a weak person's failsafe. Strategy is important (...) for the person who doesn't make it by sheer toil and effort."
Holger Jung and Jean Remy von Matt, Momentum (2002)
Many managers and business leaders glorify strategy development as the supreme discipline of company management. Others, like the German advertising gurus quoted above, regard strategy development as a waste of time. This is the polarized reality after a discussion about the whole purpose of strategy that has continued for more than 100 years. And the general understanding of strategy is somewhere in between these two poles.

Everyone knows the term, and everyone associates it with something different, depending on the context. Strategy is ambivalent and fraught with reservations. On the one hand, we understand that strategy is about intentional and focused action with rational logic behind it. On the other hand, strategy has a certain dazzling quality but also something mysterious, disreputable, and dangerous, because it is frequently associated subliminally with images of generating a relative superiority with which to deceive, trick, and take advantage of others, and is therefore correlated with morally questionable behavior. And these prejudices have an impact! In practice, this ambivalence for one thing causes strategy as a topic to be misunderstood, consciously or subconsciously, either out of self-interest or self-preservation. Because we handle anything we cannot fully understand, describe, or grasp with skepticism, rejection or even with fear.

So, let us start at the beginning. What is strategy? To us, the simplest answer is: Strategy is the path we want to take in order to get from our today to our desired future. The basis of strategy is a clear picture of what our future should look like and of what we need to get there. For Jack Welch, the former chairman and CEO of General Electric, strategy was very straightforward: "You pick a general direction and implement like hell." But if we do not know where we want to get to, we will end up who knows where. Then, sheer toil and effort, as our advertising gurus claimed, will not be enough.

When company managers think about their "strategy", they are usually thinking about nothing less than the general direction of the company as well as the key issues and measures to ensure its future viability. But in fact, they wrestle with budgets and crunch numbers in forecast and planning sessions. Even the annu-

ally recurring "retreats" customary in many large companies, where management teams temporarily lock themselves away in monasteries, extravagant conference venues, and other attractive locations "offsite" for closed strategy meetings, seldom contribute to the systematic formulation of strategic thought and action within a company or to the continuous development of corporate strategy.

That doesn't matter, anti-strategists may argue at this point. What should a person strategically plan in a complex world full of disruptions and unlawful developments, where only one thing is certain: that the future is uncertain. What was it that Albert Einstein said? "I never think about the future. It comes soon enough." That is why company managers who are stuck in the here and now dare to perform a balancing act: They only respond to changes when they occur with agility, flexibility, and resilience. Lovely buzzwords! In an overestimation of their own capability, or even with a sense of genius, these high-wire walkers prefer to obey the well-known "law" of the Rhineland (geographic and cultural area in Germany): "Et hätt noch emmer jot jejangen." Meaning: It always turned out ok before. But hoping for the best as a guiding principle has seldom turned out ok - neither in a big corporation nor in an SME that was once a "hidden champion". Nothing works without a strategy - or if it does, then only by chance.

Even if there is a strategy, company management is by no means home and dry yet. Do the employees know and understand the strategy? Do they believe in its feasibility and success? A survey conducted by consulting firm strategy\& in 2019 among 6,000 management executives reached a dramatic conclusion: 75 percent of respondents stated that they did not believe in the success of their own company's strategy, 19 percent responded that there was no guiding strategy in their company at all, while 33 percent believed that the problem was the difficult and protracted implementation, since market conditions change rapidly and constantly. Thus, according to other studies carried out by Sull et al. (2015) as well as by Collis (2021), around two-thirds of all corporate strategies fail at the implementation stage.

Results like these are grist to the mill for those who view strategy as a waste of time. For this reason, strategists must tackle the question of why strategy should be more than "art for art's sake" and why it evidently so seldom works.

From our experience of strategy processes in different company situations, there are three factors that must converge to ensure the successful formulation and implementation of a corporate strategy:

Three success factors

1. There has to be a clear definition and a common understanding about what strategy precisely means and entails.
2. A systematic and analytical approach is essential for the development of a strategy in order not to end up in randomness and who knows where.
3. Implementing a strategy requires a disciplined, structured process where coordination and communication are essential.

From our experience of what works in practice and what does not, we have developed a simple thought and action framework, the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\circledR}$, which helps strategists fulfil these three factors.

## A SMALL SHEET OF PAPER AND ITS CONSEQUENCES

When we ask management executives at the start of a training seminar or consultancy brief to formulate their company's strategy briefly and concisely on the small sheet of notepaper in front of them, a strange silence generally ensues. They obviously had not expected this kick-off. They think in silence. "You have 3 minutes." Time pressure. They finish. "Why don't you read out what you have written." What follows are descriptions of "strategies" like: "Our strategy has four value levers: innovative product solutions, optimized operational performance, customer orientation, and sustainability," "We achieve profitable growth through strategic capital allocation," or "We are volume leaders in ... and offer our customers value for money." All clear so far?

Nothing is clear. In the critical discussion that follows, these descriptive attempts quickly reveal themselves to be merely series of empty words. What exactly do "innovative", "optimized", or "strategic" mean? We provoke them a little further: "Profitable growth" is a target, not a strategy! And on top of that, it is not specific. "What" precisely is supposed to grow, "why", and "how far"? Is the sky the limit? When will growth become profitable?

The management executives' blood pressure rises. They switch to defensive and justification mode. "Our customer feedback is excellent, so we must be doing something right." That's true. But what about the customers who do not buy from

you? "We are market leaders; you must be able to gather that from our 22 percent market share. That is an objective measurement." Agreed, but as Bruce Henderson (1989), founder of consultancy firm BCG, commented:
"Market share is a meaningless number unless a company defines the market in terms of the boundaries separating it from its rivals."

What Henderson is saying is that quantifying a market position does not answer either the "why" or the "how". Why do you think, or why can you measurably prove, that you are a market leader? Because you are a big fish in a small pond? What differentiates the big fish from the small rivals? How did it achieve this market position? And furthermore: If we just make the definition of our pond narrow enough, our market share will rise to 100 percent. Here is one example: Coca-Cola's market share in the global market for carbonated soft drinks was 24.3 percent in 2021. In the US market, it was 46.3 percent (Statista, 2023). However, Coca-Cola's market share in both the global and US market for carbonated soft drinks of the Coca-Cola brand is 100 percent.

We stick to our Socratic approach and subsequently ask: How profitable is it to be a big fish? Answer: "Of course we are profitable." That's awesome, congratulations! But couldn't you do even better if the pond was bigger, or even if it was a different pond? Now the discussion becomes heated and reaches its climax. "We're not strategically positioned for a bigger pond." Ok, so you don't have an expansion plan. "And anyway, what do you mean by a different pond? Should we start selling insurance tomorrow, or what?"

We thank the management executives we had blindsided with our strategy question for their enlightening contributions to the discussion and reassure them: they are in good company. As Markides (2022) points out in the Harvard Business Review, many company strategists confuse targets and strategy. Effective strategy formulas require a common understanding of strategy. In practice, however, it is rare that much time is spent on clarifying terminology and the assumptions, ideas, and interpretations underlying it in order to reach a workable formulation of strategy which then really does fit on a sheet of notepaper and is comprehensible. In strategy processes, a great deal of time, countless discussion sessions, and hundreds of PowerPoint slides are frequently spent on activities that can be described as "planning". But strategy is a plan, not planning.

We still have one last question for the management executives, and we ask them for an honest and unemotional answer: "If your company no longer existed tomorrow, would anyone miss it?" Our honest answer: The majority of respondents come to the conclusion that their companies' customers would not miss them very long and would find a replacement for them relatively quickly. But if you

can be replaced quickly, what distinguishes you from your rivals? Is "we too" an adequate reason for being? What is your plan for being relevant in the future? Tough questions to which the strategists must find answers. As management theorist and strategy pioneer Henry Mintzberg (1994, p. 333) emphasizes, strategy is not the consequence of planning but rather its starting point. And thus necessary.

# THE NECESSARY INSIGHT 

"Strategy" as a term, concept and usage originated in the military field. The word "strategy" is derived from the Ancient Greek - "strategia": to lead an army ("stratos"). The "strategos" is the leader of the army. He/she provides direction - where the troops should be deployed - and dictates the focus which battles should be fought where and when. How the troops operate, what measures they take in order to win, depends on the one hand on the terrain in which they are moving, and on the other hand on their reservoir of tactical capabilities and how they use this reservoir to implement the strategy they are pursuing.

In the field of business, the "company" is the army. The "leaders" are usually either the company founders, their heirs, or appointed management executives. The main task of company management is to organize the company, define the core goals, make the necessary resources available, and lead the organization so that it fulfils its tasks profitably. Business historian Alfred D. Chandler (1962) provided the classical definition of strategy in Strategy and Structure, his groundbreaking study of the success factors in large corporations: "... strategy is the determination of the basic long-term goals and objectives of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals."
