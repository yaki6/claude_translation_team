clines significantly from eight to ten participants upwards. Then, in the second workshop, you can involve the broader management team with company area managers and, depending on the size of the company, where appropriate, even down to department head or team leader level. Independently of the co-creation process, there will also be opportunities during the ongoing process to integrate various stakeholder groups. For example, the viewpoints and expectations of internal and external stakeholders can be collected during qualitative interviews in the analysis phase.

# \#11: IS AN EXTERNAL CONSULTANT OR A SPARRING PARTNER REQUIRED? AND IF SO, WHO AND WHEN? 

"Do-it-yourself"? Or do you want to take advantage of external support to develop and implement your new strategy? Do you have sufficient capacity within your company (staff, resources, time, capabilities and expertise) to execute the entire process, from analysis, through cascading right up to implementation and adjustment?

Here comes a direct quote from a family-run company: "We can manage that ourselves despite limited capacities. Consultancies are expensive. After all, we're not a big corporation. In addition, consultants always just want to generate fol-low-up business." The role of consultants in strategy processes is increasingly changing. Of course, there are the big strategy consultancies that, when they receive a mandate from a large company, deploy legions of junior consultants for the core work from which experienced partners then develop customized strategies for the company executives. Naturally, expert work like this is expensive. And whether the strategy will succeed is anything but clear. Because as we know, the truth lies on the field when the game is on. By that time, the "hired guns" have long since moved on, involved in another project at another company. It is no surprise that particularly small and medium-sized companies have reservations and preconceptions about calling in external support. That is why highly specialized consultancies can increasingly score points here if they support the strategy process or parts of it as moderators, catalysts or sparring partners.

If you are considering external support, you should reflect on what your company really needs in what area of the process. External moderation can help create fair discussion conditions and initiate constructive discussions free from arguments about justification and recriminations. Consultants and sparring partners can be the people who hold up the mirror you need before you and vocalize truths that no one from inside your company would dare to express. In addition, an overhead view from outside can give you new insights and impetus. And better still, it can be profitable.

Communication is a critical success factor

The days of covert projects are over. It is a totally outdated idea that top management would sit alone behind closed doors hatching the new strategy and then present the new panacea with a "Hey presto" flourish to the organization. Get your team on board as early as possible in the strategy journey. Even if at the beginning it is merely by informing them that you are beginning deliberations in a select group of participants.

After this, the detailed work for your communication begins. Define the communication channels. Make the various steps in the planned strategy process transparent. Explain the procedure and the time and resource expenditure you envisage. Present the process roadmap. Empower people outside the management team as well to act as multipliers or strategy ambassadors within the organization. The main objective here is to communicate interim results and progress in the process.

Even at the risk of repeating ourselves, we must emphasize here: Communication is the key to the success of strategy processes. That is not a management platitude but insight based on experience. Philosopher Hans Jonas (1992) summed it up in a nutshell: "Stand firm in the conviction that how you think, what you think, what you say and how you disseminate ideas in mutual communication makes a difference to the way of things."

The "way of things" in this book is the "process".

# PLAN 

Where do most strategy processes fail? In their implementation? Maybe. But how many processes don't even make it that far because they are abandoned already at the development stage, because the understanding of strategy varies widely from person to person, or because the conditions for an organized strategy process were not created? You can do better! Try to answer as many questions as possible from the beginning. Make assumptions, expectations, and misgivings explicit so that you can gain clarity for the initial steps of the process.

## KEY QUESTIONS:

1. $\square$ Which area of your company should the strategy be developed for?
2. $\square$ Which overarching aim are you pursuing with the strategy? What is your primary focus?
3. $\square$ Do we speak the same language, and do we mean the same thing?
4. $\square$ What half-life should your strategy have?
5. $\square$ On what basis is the strategy being reoriented?
6. $\square$ What is the time frame for your strategy process?
7. $\square$ What strategic framework are you applying and how will a shared understanding of strategy emerge?
8. $\square$ Who is the sponsor of the strategy process?
9. $\square$ Who is acting as operational manager of the strategy process?
10. $\square$ Who must be involved in the strategy process and co-develop it?
11. $\square$ Is an external consultant or sparring partner required? And if so, who and when?
12. $\square$ How will the strategy process be communicated?

## INSTRUCTIONS

Work through the questions together in a smaller group. At least the sponsors and the strategy process manager should be present. The objective is to develop a shared understanding of the process ahead. Even if you cannot answer all the questions yet, exchange ideas on potential options and alternatives. Do not let anything fall by the wayside.

# WHERE YOU ARE 

Facing the truth

## FIGURES, DATA, FACTS

Before you formulate the objectives that are aligned to the challenges and opportunities and start looking for the best ways to get there, you have to understand where your company stands today, how you got there, and how your journey could continue. As Willie Pietersen (2001), a grand master of strategy, teaches us: "The starting point of any strategy is a great situation analysis. (...) Intelligence precedes operations." Another grand master, Richard Rumelt (2022), holds a similar opinion: "The key steps in dealing with a strategic challenge are a diagnosis of the situation - a comprehension of 'what's going on here,' finding the crux, and then creating reasonable action responses."

Thus, in the situation analysis, we are talking about the "Where do we stand?" It is a systematic and logically stringent approach which can be metaphorically described as a combination of Albert Einstein and Charles Darwin. In this analogy, Einstein's famous formula, $\mathrm{E}=\mathrm{mc} 2$, serves as a metaphor for investigating the interdependencies among your company's fields of activity. To do this, you and your team must first collate data and facts on these fields of activity, evaluate them and decide which information is relevant for answering the critical questions ahead, and which is not. The questions could be, for example: What are the success factors in your selected areas? What are the reasons for the discrepancies between market share and profitability? How are our relationships with customers, suppliers, and other interested parties in comparison with our competitors? Do the conclusions from the analysis of the facts and the data concur with our subjective observations and experience in the fields of activity?

Darwin examined the evolution of living beings, the emergence of biodiversity and the extinction of species from a historical perspective. He delivered explanations for reproduction, adaptation, mutation, and the survival of the most adaptable. His evolutionary research approach can act as a metaphor for the necessity to recognize development patterns and trends and comprehend their significance for our own existence. How and why is our present different from the past? How could tomorrow differ from today, and why? To throw a phrase into the mix that owes its existence to the Covid-19 pandemic: What will be the next "new normal"?

Your company and its "own realities" will be the core focus of the situation analysis: How profitable are we? How could we grow? Normally, your company will be embedded in a specific industry or sector. It will have resources and capabilities that you must combine intelligently and efficiently to make your company distinguishable from the competition.

---


# YOUR COMPANY'S STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT 

There are four general forces impacting your company. On the one hand, there is the "market forces" field. Markets are not synonymous with industries or sectors. An industry like, for example, the chemical industry has a multitude of product markets in different geographies. And a market like the car market is served by market participants from various industries (automotive manufacturers, dealerships, insurance companies, banks). Markets emerge from demarcating definitions across two dimensions: Similarity of products to satisfy identical customer requirements and geographic location of the offering.

On the market level, the forces of supply and demand affect your company. The "competition" force field lies on the supply side. Companies that offer comparable products from a customer's point of view are in competition with each other. Coca-Cola and Pepsi's best-known products are carbonated, sugary beverages. They are sold worldwide. Both companies are direct competitors globally, regionally, and locally. Likewise, Fritz-kola from Hamburg is also a direct competitor, but only in a small number of countries.

Is mineral water supplier Perrier also a direct competitor? That depends on how we define the market. It depends most of all on the "customers" force field, on their requirements and preferences. If customers are looking for a thirst-quenching, refreshing drink, independent of sugar content, then Perrier and all other mineral water producers will become direct competitors of Coca-Cola and Pepsi.

Additionally, your company is subject to overarching forces on the macro level in the "broader environment". These are exogenous factors on the macroeconomic or international level which significantly impact your actions (for example, state regulation, company taxation, trade policy). On top of these, there are the "trends", triggered for example, by overriding and enduring technological, socioeconomic or cultural developments that lead to far-reaching changes in the legacy playing fields or open up new playing fields.

To reach valid insights and viable conclusions, the situation analysis must create transparency. In short: Leave no stone unturned, do not regard anything as a random outlier. This is the only way to understand interdependencies. Then, instead of treating the symptoms, you can treat the causes specifically. By the end of the situation analysis, you have gained an understanding of how relevant your company is in its current fields of activity and how it can remain relevant for the future.

# STRATEGY KICK-OFF MEETING 

Together, we see more. How you set up your strategy process will send a powerful signal for its implementation. Be brave. Put a team together that is willing and able to adopt different perspectives and voice opposition - on merit and not based on personal vanities.

In your kick-off meeting, you should lay a foundation of trust for the joint strategy work. Always show your hand. Clarify fundamental opinions and attitudes, explain the envisaged procedure and the content of the various steps that you want to take together, and be open to a critical discussion.

## AGENDA (PROPOSAL):

1. Check-in: Formulate questions to all participants
(Example: Why do we need a strategy process?)
2. Objective: Clarify the management team's expectations
3. Methodology:

- Explain the StrategyFrame ${ }^{\circledR}$
- Introduce the key questions for each module of the situation analysis and add to them if necessary
- Suggest potential analysis tools (see individual modules)

4. Status quo (optional): Present prior estimate of data pool for the individual modules in a traffic-light system
5. Organization:

- Clarify roles in the process
- Procedure: Present the schedule and agree on it
- Agree on IT systems for data storage and project management

6. Quantitative analyses: Appoint executives responsible for collecting and analyzing the quantitative data for the individual modules
7. Define the forms of qualitative analyses
(For example, for exploratory interviews with customers, stakeholders, and the management team, name these persons specifically)
8. Check-out: Formulate questions to all participants
(Example: What contribution can I make to the process?)

## INSTRUCTIONS

Use the Socratic method of structured dialog. Key questions will lead into the topics for discussion. The answers will serve as a starting point for more in-depth questions, like for example: "Why do you see it like that?" or "What are the assumptions underlying your answer?" You should question the new answers together. Repeat the sequence: "Question - query - challenge" until you have reached a shared insight.

1. Formulate the key questions
2. Amalgamate the quantitative and qualitative data
3. Analyze and discuss
4. Derive key insights

---


## TIP

Here are five golden rules:

1. Make a diagnosis, not just an overview of the symptoms. You want to find out the cause of results and their consequences. Separate the important from the unimportant.
2. Trends tell a story; snapshots are an image of a moment in time without a "Why?" and "What comes after that?" When you are analyzing your results, look for connected chronological sequences, map these as possible trends and find the common stories behind them.
3. Keep it short and simple (KISS)! Don't overcomplicate results. Searching for meaning requires crystal-clear answers. Simplicity is not a shortcut; it is a virtue, and it is hard work.
4. Avoid overused phrases or jargon! Formulate your thoughts and insights in such a way even outsiders will understand them. Speak your customers' language instead of corporate gibberish.
5. Reaching a consensus is the wrong objective: The best ideas should prevail, not the "average" or the lowest common denominator.

## CAUTION

You should select your management team so that it is big enough to have diversity, but it should not be too big either to keep the complexity of agreement low. In our experience, a core team with five to six people, including the strategy process manager, works well. The question of who should be on the team often depends decisively, alongside professional competence and position, on internal culture and politics. Of course, you can also define a larger circle, for example, because you want to give someone their first chance to prove themselves, or because you would like to include people who can act as multipliers to ensure acceptance for your strategy process among the workforce. However, you should not go beyond 10 to 12 participants.
